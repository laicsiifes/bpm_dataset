{"id":6,"text":"The Process Audit is a business process that aims to ensure the quality of customer service. \n\nThis process involves the actors Quality Manager (QM), Customer Relationship Manager (CRM), Production Manager (PM), Production Director (PD), and Market and Sales Director (MSD). \n\nMonthly quality audits are conducted on customer service processes. \n\nFirst, a statistical analysis is performed. \n\nIf the data indicates a Critical Defect Index (CDI), a detailed report of the defects is produced and forwarded to the Production Manager. \n\nUpon receiving the report, the Production Manager must analyze all registered occurrences, identify the causes of the occurrence. \n\nIn case no cause is identified, the PM must justify the occurrence. \n\nThe PM sends the report to the QM containing the actions to be taken to reduce the defect index. \n\nThe QM analyzes the PM's report. If the QM approves the report, the process is terminated. \n\nOtherwise, the report is sent back to the PM for reformulation. \n\nThe process continues in this way for a period of 15 days or until the report is approved. \n\nIf the 15-day deadline expires, the Production Director is notified of the report's rejection, and the process ends. \n\nIf the rate of unsolved problems by the Attendant is less than 70%, the Customer Service Manager is invited to analyze the occurrence report and verify if the procedures adopted by the attendant were correct. \n\nAfter this analysis, the CRM must create a report identifying the causes and reasons for the unresolved issues. \n\nThe approval of this report follows the same model as the report forwarded to the PM. \n\nIf the report is not approved within 15 days, the Market and Sales Director (MSD) is notified.\n\n If none of the cases occur, a final report is generated, informing all actors involved, and the process is terminated.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":984,"label":"trigger","start_offset":356,"end_offset":389},{"id":985,"label":"condition","start_offset":393,"end_offset":444},{"id":986,"label":"activity","start_offset":448,"end_offset":490},{"id":987,"label":"activity","start_offset":495,"end_offset":507},{"id":988,"label":"actor","start_offset":512,"end_offset":530},{"id":989,"label":"actor","start_offset":565,"end_offset":583},{"id":990,"label":"activity","start_offset":589,"end_offset":623},{"id":991,"label":"activity","start_offset":625,"end_offset":662},{"id":992,"label":"condition","start_offset":666,"end_offset":696},{"id":993,"label":"actor","start_offset":702,"end_offset":704},{"id":994,"label":"activity","start_offset":710,"end_offset":732},{"id":995,"label":"actor","start_offset":740,"end_offset":742},{"id":996,"label":"trigger","start_offset":743,"end_offset":762},{"id":997,"label":"actor","start_offset":767,"end_offset":769},{"id":998,"label":"activity","start_offset":808,"end_offset":831},{"id":999,"label":"actor","start_offset":839,"end_offset":841},{"id":1000,"label":"activity","start_offset":842,"end_offset":866},{"id":1001,"label":"condition","start_offset":868,"end_offset":897},{"id":1002,"label":"catch","start_offset":903,"end_offset":924},{"id":1003,"label":"condition","start_offset":928,"end_offset":937},{"id":1004,"label":"catch","start_offset":943,"end_offset":965},{"id":1005,"label":"actor","start_offset":970,"end_offset":972},{"id":1008,"label":"condition","start_offset":1087,"end_offset":1117},{"id":1009,"label":"actor","start_offset":1123,"end_offset":1142},{"id":1010,"label":"activity","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1180},{"id":1011,"label":"catch","start_offset":1190,"end_offset":1202},{"id":1012,"label":"condition","start_offset":1206,"end_offset":1272},{"id":1013,"label":"actor","start_offset":1278,"end_offset":1302},{"id":1016,"label":"actor","start_offset":1442,"end_offset":1445},{"id":1019,"label":"condition","start_offset":1619,"end_offset":1663},{"id":1020,"label":"actor","start_offset":1669,"end_offset":1694},{"id":1021,"label":"trigger","start_offset":1704,"end_offset":1712},{"id":1022,"label":"condition","start_offset":1715,"end_offset":1743},{"id":1023,"label":"activity","start_offset":1746,"end_offset":1771},{"id":1024,"label":"catch","start_offset":1812,"end_offset":1833},{"id":1026,"label":"condition","start_offset":1055,"end_offset":1083},{"id":1027,"label":"activity","start_offset":998,"end_offset":1015},{"id":1028,"label":"condition","start_offset":1019,"end_offset":1051},{"id":1029,"label":"activity","start_offset":1451,"end_offset":1527},{"id":1030,"label":"trigger","start_offset":1306,"end_offset":1346},{"id":1031,"label":"activity","start_offset":1351,"end_offset":1413}],"relations":[{"id":448,"from_id":986,"to_id":985,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":450,"from_id":987,"to_id":988,"type":"perform"},{"id":451,"from_id":987,"to_id":986,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":453,"from_id":985,"to_id":984,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":454,"from_id":989,"to_id":990,"type":"perform"},{"id":455,"from_id":989,"to_id":991,"type":"perform"},{"id":456,"from_id":991,"to_id":990,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":457,"from_id":993,"to_id":994,"type":"perform"},{"id":458,"from_id":994,"to_id":992,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":459,"from_id":995,"to_id":996,"type":"perform"},{"id":460,"from_id":996,"to_id":997,"type":"perform"},{"id":461,"from_id":997,"to_id":998,"type":"perform"},{"id":462,"from_id":999,"to_id":1000,"type":"perform"},{"id":463,"from_id":1002,"to_id":1001,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":464,"from_id":1004,"to_id":1003,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":465,"from_id":1004,"to_id":1005,"type":"perform"},{"id":466,"from_id":1001,"to_id":1000,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":471,"from_id":1010,"to_id":1009,"type":"perform"},{"id":472,"from_id":1011,"to_id":1010,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":473,"from_id":1010,"to_id":1008,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":479,"from_id":1016,"to_id":1029,"type":"perform"},{"id":480,"from_id":1020,"to_id":1021,"type":"perform"},{"id":481,"from_id":1021,"to_id":1019,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":482,"from_id":1023,"to_id":1022,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":483,"from_id":1024,"to_id":1023,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":484,"from_id":1030,"to_id":1013,"type":"perform"},{"id":485,"from_id":1013,"to_id":1031,"type":"perform"},{"id":486,"from_id":1031,"to_id":1030,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":487,"from_id":1030,"to_id":1012,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":488,"from_id":1003,"to_id":1000,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}

If it is not possible to determine a\nmain travel destination, the member country of first entry into the Schengen area is responsible for issuing the visa.\n\nTerritorial competence for applications for category A and C visas falls to the representation office in the consular district where the legal place of residence of the applicant is located. A representation office may claim exceptional competence for applications from third‑country nationals legally residing but not registered in their district if the applicant can provide  justification as to why they had to submit their application to that particular consulate.\n\nType D visas, however, must be applied for at the competent Austrian representation. The provisions of Section 8 of the FPG apply to type D visas. In accordance with these provisions, the territorial competence for carrying out official actions in relation to visas is determined on the basis of the foreign national's the place of residence (i.e.

{"id":58,"text":"At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded. A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO. At the customer service an employee enters (based on the received data) a problem report into system T. Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are. Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities. An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship. In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here). In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues. Taking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is created. The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management. Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers. After receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning. In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning. If Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem. After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems. If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created. If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created. Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management. Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information. Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report. Three alternative process paths may be taken. For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service. For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves. Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service. After sending, this process path of Service Management ends. For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration. This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning. Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process. After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked. Based on the tracked errors, all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning. Then a trouble-shooting report is created. This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends. The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii). If there was no problem, Customer Service either receives the actual service performance or the problem resolution report. Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing. The report for the customer is sent out to her. After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service. After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":1643,"label":"actor","start_offset":21,"end_offset":29},{"id":1644,"label":"trigger","start_offset":30,"end_offset":80},{"id":1645,"label":"actor","start_offset":141,"end_offset":168},{"id":1646,"label":"activity","start_offset":84,"end_offset":133},{"id":1647,"label":"actor","start_offset":207,"end_offset":215},{"id":1648,"label":"activity","start_offset":216,"end_offset":280},{"id":1649,"label":"actor","start_offset":293,"end_offset":307},{"id":1650,"label":"activity","start_offset":311,"end_offset":339},{"id":1651,"label":"activity","start_offset":435,"end_offset":477},{"id":1652,"label":"actor","start_offset":519,"end_offset":537},{"id":1653,"label":"activity","start_offset":543,"end_offset":586},{"id":1654,"label":"condition","start_offset":683,"end_offset":715},{"id":1655,"label":"activity","start_offset":721,"end_offset":770},{"id":1656,"label":"condition","start_offset":813,"end_offset":924},{"id":1658,"label":"activity","start_offset":930,"end_offset":979},{"id":1659,"label":"condition","start_offset":980,"end_offset":989},{"id":1660,"label":"activity","start_offset":994,"end_offset":1011},{"id":1661,"label":"activity","start_offset":1101,"end_offset":1135},{"id":1662,"label":"actor","start_offset":1181,"end_offset":1199},{"id":1664,"label":"actor","start_offset":1201,"end_offset":1219},{"id":1665,"label":"activity","start_offset":1220,"end_offset":1281},{"id":1666,"label":"actor","start_offset":1359,"end_offset":1377},{"id":1667,"label":"trigger","start_offset":1141,"end_offset":1180},{"id":1668,"label":"activity","start_offset":1378,"end_offset":1457},{"id":1669,"label":"activity","start_offset":1461,"end_offset":1520},{"id":1670,"label":"condition","start_offset":1521,"end_offset":1604},{"id":1673,"label":"trigger","start_offset":1610,"end_offset":1670},{"id":1674,"label":"condition","start_offset":1672,"end_offset":1721},{"id":1675,"label":"actor","start_offset":1723,"end_offset":1727},{"id":1676,"label":"activity","start_offset":1728,"end_offset":1748},{"id":1677,"label":"actor","start_offset":1774,"end_offset":1778},{"id":1678,"label":"activity","start_offset":1779,"end_offset":1837},{"id":1679,"label":"activity","start_offset":1911,"end_offset":1958},{"id":1680,"label":"condition","start_offset":1959,"end_offset":1987},{"id":1681,"label":"activity","start_offset":1991,"end_offset":2049},{"id":1682,"label":"condition","start_offset":2051,"end_offset":2075},{"id":1683,"label":"activity","start_offset":2088,"end_offset":2122},{"id":1684,"label":"activity","start_offset":2129,"end_offset":2154},{"id":1687,"label":"actor","start_offset":2288,"end_offset":2306},{"id":1688,"label":"activity","start_offset":2312,"end_offset":2378},{"id":1689,"label":"activity","start_offset":2406,"end_offset":2454},{"id":1690,"label":"condition","start_offset":2558,"end_offset":2606},{"id":1691,"label":"activity","start_offset":2612,"end_offset":2654},{"id":1692,"label":"actor","start_offset":2659,"end_offset":2675},{"id":1693,"label":"condition","start_offset":2677,"end_offset":2732},{"id":1694,"label":"actor","start_offset":2734,"end_offset":2752},{"id":1695,"label":"activity","start_offset":2758,"end_offset":2800},{"id":1696,"label":"activity","start_offset":2820,"end_offset":2856},{"id":1697,"label":"activity","start_offset":2865,"end_offset":2877},{"id":1698,"label":"actor","start_offset":2878,"end_offset":2894},{"id":1699,"label":"catch","start_offset":2916,"end_offset":2955},{"id":1700,"label":"condition","start_offset":2957,"end_offset":3044},{"id":1702,"label":"actor","start_offset":3046,"end_offset":3064},{"id":1703,"label":"activity","start_offset":3070,"end_offset":3121},{"id":1704,"label":"activity","start_offset":3128,"end_offset":3151},{"id":1705,"label":"actor","start_offset":3152,"end_offset":3173},{"id":1706,"label":"actor","start_offset":3175,"end_offset":3196},{"id":1707,"label":"activity","start_offset":3201,"end_offset":3213},{"id":1708,"label":"activity","start_offset":3218,"end_offset":3251},{"id":1709,"label":"condition","start_offset":3266,"end_offset":3323},{"id":1710,"label":"condition","start_offset":3325,"end_offset":3334},{"id":1711,"label":"actor","start_offset":3335,"end_offset":3356},{"id":1712,"label":"catch","start_offset":3357,"end_offset":3379},{"id":1713,"label":"activity","start_offset":3424,"end_offset":3455},{"id":1714,"label":"activity","start_offset":3486,"end_offset":3533},{"id":1715,"label":"actor","start_offset":3537,"end_offset":3558},{"id":1716,"label":"activity","start_offset":3567,"end_offset":3601},{"id":1717,"label":"activity","start_offset":3608,"end_offset":3629},{"id":1718,"label":"actor","start_offset":3630,"end_offset":3648},{"id":1719,"label":"catch","start_offset":3659,"end_offset":3671},{"id":1720,"label":"activity","start_offset":3677,"end_offset":3712},{"id":1721,"label":"actor","start_offset":3716,"end_offset":3734},{"id":1723,"label":"activity","start_offset":3775,"end_offset":3842},{"id":1727,"label":"condition",

{"id":59,"text":"The process is initiated by a switch-over request. In doing so, the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company. Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution. The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system. After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility. In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow. This object consists of data elements such as the customers name and address and the assigned power gauge. The generated customer object is then used, in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch (including data such as bank connection, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over). In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer information system) in order to confirm their successful generation. In case of a negative response, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved. Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again. In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed. A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence, and the grid operator transmits a response comment. In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict. The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier (i.e. the customer service (of the new supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination). If there are not any objections by the grid operator (i.e. no supplier concurrence), customer service creates a CIS contract. The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it. Depending on the customers acceptance\/rejection the process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation). An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues. The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process. On the switch-date, but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun, the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report. At the same time, the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier. Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer. For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then. After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information.

{"id":63,"text":"Whenever a company makes the decision to go public, its first task is to select the underwriters. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public. Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a companys issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it. They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they havent still found any reason not to do it.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":1877,"label":"actor","start_offset":11,"end_offset":18},{"id":1878,"label":"trigger","start_offset":19,"end_offset":50},{"id":1879,"label":"activity","start_offset":70,"end_offset":96},{"id":1880,"label":"actor","start_offset":98,"end_offset":110},{"id":1881,"label":"activity","start_offset":111,"end_offset":136},{"id":1882,"label":"actor","start_offset":192,"end_offset":196},{"id":1883,"label":"activity","start_offset":197,"end_offset":253},{"id":1884,"label":"actor","start_offset":259,"end_offset":265},{"id":1886,"label":"activity","start_offset":265,"end_offset":278},{"id":1887,"label":"actor","start_offset":292,"end_offset":297},{"id":1888,"label":"activity","start_offset":297,"end_offset":320},{"id":1890,"label":"actor","start_offset":533,"end_offset":545},{"id":1891,"label":"activity","start_offset":556,"end_offset":589},{"id":1892,"label":"actor","start_offset":591,"end_offset":595},{"id":1893,"label":"activity","start_offset":596,"end_offset":628},{"id":1894,"label":"actor","start_offset":746,"end_offset":750},{"id":1896,"label":"activity","start_offset":759,"end_offset":821},{"id":1898,"label":"actor","start_offset":943,"end_offset":955},{"id":1899,"label":"activity","start_offset":956,"end_offset":988},{"id":1900,"label":"actor","start_offset":990,"end_offset":994},{"id":1901,"label":"activity","start_offset":994,"end_offset":1045},{"id":1902,"label":"actor","start_offset":1065,"end_offset":1070},{"id":1903,"label":"activity","start_offset":1070,"end_offset":1100},{"id":1904,"label":"actor","start_offset":1102,"end_offset":1114},{"id":1905,"label":"activity","start_offset":1115,"end_offset":1134},{"id":1906,"label":"actor","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1152},{"id":1907,"label":"activity","start_offset":1152,"end_offset":1197},{"id":1910,"label":"condition","start_offset":1231,"end_offset":1283},{"id":1911,"label":"catch","start_offset":1207,"end_offset":1229}],"relations":[{"id":1077,"from_id":1877,"to_id":1878,"type":"perform"},{"id":1078,"from_id":1879,"to_id":1878,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1079,"from_id":1880,"to_id":1881,"type":"perform"},{"id":1080,"from_id":1881,"to_id":1879,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1081,"from_id":1882,"to_id":1883,"type":"perform"},{"id":1082,"from_id":1884,"to_id":1886,"type":"perform"},{"id":1083,"from_id":1887,"to_id":1888,"type":"perform"},{"id":1084,"from_id":1886,"to_id":1883,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1085,"from_id":1888,"to_id":1886,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1086,"from_id":1890,"to_id":1891,"type":"perform"},{"id":1087,"from_id":1892,"to_id":1893,"type":"perform"},{"id":1088,"from_id":1893,"to_id":1891,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1089,"from_id":1894,"to_id":1896,"type":"perform"},{"id":1090,"from_id":1896,"to_id":1893,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1091,"from_id":1898,"to_id":1899,"type":"perform"},{"id":1092,"from_id":1899,"to_id":1896,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1093,"from_id":1900,"to_id":1901,"type":"perform"},{"id":1094,"from_id":1901,"to_id":1899,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1095,"from_id":1902,"to_id":1903,"type":"perform"},{"id":1096,"from_id":1903,"to_id":1901,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1097,"from_id":1904,"to_id":1905,"type":"perform"},{"id":1098,"from_id":1905,"to_id":1903,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1099,"from_id":1906,"to_id":1907,"type":"perform"},{"id":1100,"from_id":1907,"to_id":1905,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1101,"from_id":1911,"to_id":1910,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1102,"from_id":1911,"to_id":1907,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}

{"id":70,"text":"The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute. This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment. The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient. On the basis of this information, the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in. The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental, health, and social state of the patient in question. This information is recorded on a registration form. At the end of the conversation, this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute. Here, the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed. For new patients, a patient file is created. The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file. Patient files are kept at the secretarial office and may not leave the building. At the secretarial office, two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient. The registration card contains a set of basic patient data. The new patient is added on the list of new notices. Halfway the week, at Wednesday, a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place. The medical team consists of social-medical workers, physicians, and a psychiatrist. At this meeting, the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team. Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker, who will act as the first intaker of the patient. One of the physicians will act as the second intaker. In assigning intakers, the teamleader takes into account their expertise, the region they are responsible for, earlier contacts they might have had with the patient, and their case load. The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office. For each new assignment, it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required. This information is added to the assignment list. The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system. It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient. An intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office. For each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file. As soon as this copy is received, the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file. The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible. During the first meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out. Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook. After a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient. The standard checklist is also added to the patient’s file. The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received. Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the information is added to the patient file. As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status. For the staff meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients.

{"id":74,"text":"An employee purchases a product or service he requires. For instance, a sales person on a trip rents a car. The employee submits an expense report with a list of items, along with the receipts for each item. A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report. Since the company has expense rules, there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection. These rules could be automated, to reduce the workload on the supervisor. If the supervisor rejects the report, the employee, who submitted it, is given a chance to edit it, for example to correct errors or better describe an expense. If the supervisor approves the report, it goes to the treasurer. The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list. If all is in order, the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing (including, e.g. , payment or refund, and accounting). If receipts are missing or do not match the report, he sends it back to the employee. If a report returns to the employee for corrections, it must again go to a supervisor, even if the supervisor previously approved the report. If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing, the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system. The process waits for the payment confirmation. After the payment is confirmed, the process ends.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":2137,"label":"actor","start_offset":3,"end_offset":11},{"id":2138,"label":"trigger","start_offset":12,"end_offset":54},{"id":2139,"label":"actor","start_offset":112,"end_offset":120},{"id":2140,"label":"activity","start_offset":121,"end_offset":167},{"id":2141,"label":"actor","start_offset":210,"end_offset":220},{"id":2142,"label":"activity","start_offset":221,"end_offset":247},{"id":2143,"label":"activity","start_offset":252,"end_offset":282},{"id":2144,"label":"condition","start_offset":495,"end_offset":531},{"id":2145,"label":"actor","start_offset":537,"end_offset":545},{"id":2146,"label":"activity","start_offset":568,"end_offset":593},{"id":2147,"label":"condition","start_offset":656,"end_offset":693},{"id":2148,"label":"activity","start_offset":695,"end_offset":705},{"id":2149,"label":"actor","start_offset":710,"end_offset":719},{"id":2150,"label":"actor","start_offset":725,"end_offset":734},{"id":2153,"label":"activity","start_offset":735,"end_offset":763},{"id":2154,"label":"condition","start_offset":817,"end_offset":835},{"id":2155,"label":"actor","start_offset":841,"end_offset":850},{"id":2157,"label":"activity","start_offset":851,"end_offset":886},{"id":2158,"label":"condition","start_offset":942,"end_offset":992},{"id":2159,"label":"actor","start_offset":994,"end_offset":996},{"id":2160,"label":"activity","start_offset":997,"end_offset":1013},{"id":2161,"label":"actor","start_offset":1018,"end_offset":1026},{"id":2162,"label":"condition","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1079},{"id":2163,"label":"activity","start_offset":1081,"end_offset":1100},{"id":2164,"label":"actor","start_offset":1103,"end_offset":1113},{"id":2166,"label":"condition","start_offset":1170,"end_offset":1222},{"id":2167,"label":"activity","start_offset":1224,"end_offset":1265},{"id":2170,"label":"actor","start_offset":1302,"end_offset":1309},{"id":2171,"label":"activity","start_offset":1310,"end_offset":1344},{"id":4418,"label":"catch","start_offset":1382,"end_offset":1394}],"relations":[{"id":1281,"from_id":2137,"to_id":2138,"type":"perform"},{"id":1282,"from_id":2139,"to_id":2140,"type":"perform"},{"id":1283,"from_id":2141,"to_id":2142,"type":"perform"},{"id":1284,"from_id":2141,"to_id":2143,"type":"perform"},{"id":1285,"from_id":2143,"to_id":2142,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1286,"from_id":2142,"to_id":2140,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1287,"from_id":2140,"to_id":2138,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1288,"from_id":2145,"to_id":2146,"type":"perform"},{"id":1289,"from_id":2146,"to_id":2144,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1290,"from_id":2148,"to_id":2149,"type":"perform"},{"id":1291,"from_id":2148,"to_id":2147,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1292,"from_id":2150,"to_id":2153,"type":"perform"},{"id":1293,"from_id":2153,"to_id":2148,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1294,"from_id":2155,"to_id":2157,"type":"perform"},{"id":1295,"from_id":2157,"to_id":2154,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1296,"from_id":2159,"to_id":2160,"type":"perform"},{"id":1297,"from_id":2160,"to_id":2161,"type":"perform"},{"id":1298,"from_id":2160,"to_id":2158,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1299,"from_id":2163,"to_id":2164,"type":"perform"},{"id":1300,"from_id":2163,"to_id":2162,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1301,"from_id":2167,"to_id":2166,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1303,"from_id":2170,"to_id":2171,"type":"perform"},{"id":1305,"from_id":2171,"to_id":2167,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2888,"from_id":4418,"to_id":2171,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}
{"id":75,"text":"As a basic principle, ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax. These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee. In ”ACME Financial Accounting”, a software specially developed for the ACME AG, she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance (invoice). She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form (”docket”).The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list. He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice. Should everything be in order, he notes his code one on the docket (”accurate position - AP”) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail. From it, the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager, based on the docket, or if all items are marked correct, sent back to accounting. Therefore, the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate. However, if inconsistencies exist, e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality, the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket, and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly. Based on the statements of the cost center managers, she will proceede with the clarification with the vendor, but, if necessary, she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again. When all inconsistencies are resolved, the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again, and the process continues. After all invoice items are AP, the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager. He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment. If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20,000, the Board wants to check it again (4-eyes-principle). The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file. Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit, it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier. After the commercial audit is successfully completed, the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in ”ACME financial accounting”.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":2174,"label":"actor","start_offset":91,"end_offset":102},{"id":2176,"label":"activity","start_offset":128,"end_offset":137},{"id":2177,"label":"actor","start_offset":176,"end_offset":195},{"id":2178,"label":"activity","start_offset":146,"end_offset":172},{"id":2179,"label":"actor","start_offset":277,"end_offset":280},{"id":2180,"label":"activity","start_offset":281,"end_offset":314},{"id":2181,"label":"activity","start_offset":319,"end_offset":351},{"id":2182,"label":"actor","start_offset":353,"end_offset":356},{"id":2183,"label":"activity","start_offset":362,"end_offset":386},{"id":2186,"label":"activity","start_offset":391,"end_offset":478},{"id":2200,"label":"actor","start_offset":619,"end_offset":656},{"id":2201,"label":"activity","start_offset":527,"end_offset":614},{"id":2202,"label":"actor","start_offset":658,"end_offset":660},{"id":2203,"label":"activity","start_offset":661,"end_offset":693},{"id":2204,"label":"actor","start_offset":766,"end_offset":768},{"id":2205,"label":"activity","start_offset":769,"end_offset":801},{"id":2206,"label":"activity","start_offset":833,"end_offset":885},{"id":2207,"label":"condition","start_offset":735,"end_offset":764},{"id":2208,"label":"actor","start_offset":940,"end_offset":964},{"id":2209,"label":"activity","start_offset":896,"end_offset":935},{"id":2210,"label":"condition","start_offset":990,"end_offset":1021},{"id":2211,"label":"activity","start_offset":1023,"end_offset":1046},{"id":2212,"label":"actor","start_offset":1134,"end_offset":1154},{"id":2213,"label":"activity","start_offset":1059,"end_offset":1108},{"id":2214,"label":"condition","start_offset":1219,"end_offset":1243},{"id":2215,"label":"actor","start_offset":1326,"end_offset":1345},{"id":2216,"label":"activity","start_offset":1346,"end_offset":1412},{"id":2217,"label":"activity","start_offset":1418,"end_offset":1477},{"id":2218,"label":"actor","start_offset":1532,"end_offset":1535},{"id":2219,"label":"activity","start_offset":1541,"end_offset":1577},{"id":2220,"label":"actor","start_offset":1582,"end_offset":1588},{"id":2221,"label":"condition","start_offset":1595,"end_offset":1607},{"id":2222,"label":"actor","start_offset":1609,"end_offset":1612},{"id":2223,"label":"activity","start_offset":1613,"end_offset":1621},{"id":2224,"label":"actor","start_offset":1626,"end_offset":1646},{"id":2225,"label":"condition","start_offset":1677,"end_offset":1714},{"id":2226,"label":"actor","start_offset":1755,"end_offset":1775},{"id":2227,"label":"activity","start_offset":1716,"end_offset":1750},{"id":2228,"label":"actor","start_offset":1846,"end_offset":1865},{"id":2229,"label":"activity","start_offset":1866,"end_offset":1901},{"id":2230,"label":"actor","start_offset":1906,"end_offset":1924},{"id":2231,"label":"actor","start_offset":1926,"end_offset":1928},{"id":2232,"label":"activity","start_offset":1929,"end_offset":1955},{"id":2233,"label":"activity","start_offset":1960,"end_offset":1991},{"id":2234,"label":"condition","start_offset":1992,"end_offset":2030},{"id":2235,"label":"actor","start_offset":2036,"end_offset":2041},{"id":2236,"label":"activity","start_offset":2042,"end_offset":2065},{"id":2237,"label":"activity","start_offset":2086,"end_offset":2144},{"id":2238,"label":"actor","start_offset":2149,"end_offset":2168},{"id":2239,"label":"condition","start_offset":2204,"end_offset":2259},{"id":2240,"label":"activity","start_offset":2261,"end_offset":2283},{"id":2241,"label":"actor","start_offset":2288,"end_offset":2307},{"id":2242,"label":"actor","start_offset":2317,"end_offset":2325},{"id":2243,"label":"actor","start_offset":2385,"end_offset":2404},{"id":2244,"label":"activity","start_offset":2405,"end_offset":2431},{"id":2245,"label":"catch","start_offset":2436,"end_offset":2486},{"id":2246,"label":"trigger","start_offset":65,"end_offset":86}],"relations":[{"id":1308,"from_id":2246,"to_id":2174,"type":"perform"},{"id":1309,"from_id":2176,"to_id":2246,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1310,"from_id":2178,"to_id":2176,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1311,"from_id":2179,"to_id":2180,"type":"perform"},{"id":1312,"from_id":2181,"to_id":2180,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1313,"from_id":2182,"to_id":2183,"type":"perform"},{"id":1314,"from_id":2182,"to_id":2186,"type":"perform"},{"id":1315,"from_id":2186,"to_id":2183,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1316,"from_id":2201,"to_id":2200,"type":"perform"},{"id":1317,"from_id":2201,"to_id":2186,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1318,"from_id":2202,"to_id":2203,"type":"perform"},{"id":1319,"from_id":2204,"to_id":2205,"type":"perform"},{"id":1320,"from_id":2205,"to_id":2207,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1321,"from_id":2206,"to_id":2205,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1322,"from_id":2209,"to_id":2206,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1323,"from_id":2209,"to_id":2208,"type":"perform"},{"id":1324,"from_id":2211,"to_id":2210,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1325,"from_id":2213,"to_id":2212,"type":"per

Sometimes, we buy details for cold calls, sometimes, our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes, you just happen to know somebody, who is interested in the product. Then we start calling the customer. That is done by the call center staff. They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project. Of course, asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important. If this is not the case, we leave him alone, except if the potential project budget is huge. Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer. If the customer is interested in the end, the next step is a detailed online presentation.

If the design fails the test, then it is sent back to the first Activity (in the department) to review and create a new Update Plan. If the design passes the test, then it tells the other department that they need to restart their work. When both of the designs have been revised, they are combined and tested. If the combined design fails the test, then they are both sent back to the beginning to initiate another design cycle. If the designs pass the test, then they are deemed complete and are then sent to the manufacturing Process [a separate Process].","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":2443,"label":"condition","start_offset":384,"end_offset":398},{"id":2444,"label":"activity","start_offset":405,"end_offset":432},{"id":2445,"label":"activity","start_offset":442,"end_offset":461},{"id":2450,"label":"activity","start_offset":527,"end_offset":556},{"id":2451,"label":"activity","start_offset":574,"end_offset":614},{"id":2452,"label":"trigger","start_offset":747,"end_offset":772},{"id":2453,"label":"condition","start_offset":774,"end_offset":788},{"id":2454,"label":"activity","start_offset":793,"end_offset":817},{"id":2455,"label":"condition","start_offset":819,"end_offset":847},{"id":2456,"label":"catch","start_offset":860,"end_offset":891},{"id":2457,"label":"condition","start_offset":952,"end_offset":981},{"id":2458,"label":"activity","start_offset":991,"end_offset":1054},{"id":2459,"label":"condition","start_offset":1056,"end_offset":1098},{"id":2460,"label":"activity","start_offset":1100,"end_offset":1128},{"id":2461,"label":"condition","start_offset":1130,"end_offset":1167},{"id":2462,"label":"catch","start_offset":1174,"end_offset":1214},{"id":2463,"label":"condition","start_offset":1249,"end_offset":1277},{"id":2464,"label":"activity","start_offset":1284,"end_offset":1308},{"id":2465,"label":"catch","start_offset":1322,"end_offset":1355}],"relations":[{"id":1499,"from_id":2444,"to_id":2443,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1500,"from_id":2445,"to_id":2444,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1501,"from_id":2450,"to_id":2445,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1502,"from_id":2451,"to_id":2450,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1503,"from_id":2452,"to_id":2451,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1504,"from_id":2454,"to_id":2453,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1505,"from_id":2456,"to_id":2455,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1506,"from_id":2458,"to_id":2457,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1507,"from_id":2460,"to_id":2459,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1508,"from_id":2462,"to_id":2461,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1509,"from_id":2464,"to_id":2463,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1510,"from_id":2465,"to_id":2464,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}

{"id":105,"text":"BuildIT is a construction company specialized in public works (roads, bridges, pipelines, tunnels, railroads, etc.). Within BuildIT, it often happens that engineers working at a construction site (called site engineers) need a piece of equipment, such as a truck, an excavator, a bulldozer, a water pump, etc. BuildIT owns very little equipment and instead it rents most of its equipment from specialized suppliers.\nThe existing business process for renting equipment goes as follows. When site engineers\nneed to rent a piece of equipment, they fill in a form called “Equipment Rental Request” and send this request by e-mail to one of the clerks at the company’s depot. The clerk at the depot receives the request and, after consulting the catalogs of the equipment suppliers, selects the most cost-effective equipment that complies with the request. Next, the clerk checks the availability of the selected equipment with the supplier via phone or e-mail. Sometimes the selected option is not available and the clerk has to select an alternative piece of equipment and check its availability with the corresponding supplier.\nOnce the clerk has found a suitable piece of equipment available for rental, the clerk adds the details of the selected equipment to the rental request. Every rental request has to be approved by a works engineer, who also works at the depot. In some cases, the works engineer rejects the equipment rental request. Some rejections lead to the cancellation of the request (no equipment is rented at all). Other rejections are resolved by replacing the selected equipment with another equipment—such as a cheaper piece of equipment or a more appropriate piece of equipment for the job. In the latter case, the clerk needs to perform another availability enquiry.\nWhen a works engineer approves a rental request, the clerk sends a confirmation to the supplier. This confirmation includes a Purchase Order (PO) for renting the equipment. The PO is produced by BuildIT’s financial information system using information entered by the clerk. The clerk also records the engagement of the equipment in a spreadsheet that is maintained for the purpose of tracking all equipment rentals.\nIn the meantime, the site engineer may decide that the equipment is no longer needed. In this case, the engineer asks the clerk to cancel the request for renting the equipment. In due time, the supplier delivers the rented equipment to the construction site. The site engineer then inspects the equipment. If everything is in order, the engineer accepts the engagement and the equipment is put into use. In some cases, the equipment is sent back because it does not comply with the requirements of the site engineer. In this case, the site engineer has to start the rental process all over again.\nWhen the rental period expires, the supplier comes to pick up the equipment. Sometimes, the site engineer asks for an extension of the rental period by contacting the supplier via e-mail or phone 1–2 days before pick-up. The supplier may accept or reject this request. A few days after the equipment is picked up, the equipment’s supplier sends an invoice to the clerk by e-mail. At this point, the clerk asks the site engineer to confirm that the equipment was indeed rented for the period indicated in the invoice.

{"id":106,"text":"In order to apply for admission, students first fill in an online form. Online applications are recorded in an information system to which all staff members involved in the admissions process have access to. After a student has submitted the online form, a PDF document is generated and the student is requested to download it, sign it, and send it by post together with the required documents, which include: Certified copies of previous degree and academic transcripts, Results of English language test and Curriculum vitae.\nWhen these documents are received by the admissions office, an officer checks the com- pleteness of the documents. If any document is missing, an e-mail is sent to the student. The\nstudent has to send the missing documents by post. Assuming the application is complete, the admissions office sends the certified copies of the degrees to an academic recognition agency, which checks the degrees and gives an assessment of their validity and equivalence in terms of local education standards. This agency requires that all documents be sent to it by post, and all documents must be certified copies of the originals. The agency sends back its assessment to the university by post as well. Assuming the degree verification is successful, the English language test results are then checked online by an officer at the admissions office. If the validity of the English language test results cannot be verified, the application is rejected (such notifications of rejection are sent by e-mail). \nOnce all documents of a given student have been validated, the admission office forwards these documents by internal mail to the corresponding academic committee responsible for deciding whether to offer admission or not. The committee makes its decision based on the academic transcripts and the CV. The committee meets once every 2 to 3 weeks and examines all applications that are ready for academic assessment at the time of the meeting. At the end of the committee meeting, the chair of the committee notifies the admissions office of the selection outcomes. This notification includes a list of admitted and rejected candidates. A few days later, the admission office notifies the outcome to each candidate via e-mail. Additionally, successful candidates are sent a confirmation letter by post.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":2938,"label":"actor","start_offset":33,"end_offset":41},{"id":2939,"label":"trigger","start_offset":48,"end_offset":70},{"id":2940,"label":"actor","start_offset":291,"end_offset":298},{"id":2941,"label":"activity","start_offset":302,"end_offset":326},{"id":2942,"label":"activity","start_offset":328,"end_offset":335},{"id":2943,"label":"activity","start_offset":341,"end_offset":348},{"id":2944,"label":"actor","start_offset":590,"end_offset":597},{"id":2945,"label":"condition","start_offset":527,"end_offset":585},{"id":2946,"label":"activity","start_offset":598,"end_offset":640},{"id":2947,"label":"condition","start_offset":642,"end_offset":668},{"id":2948,"label":"actor","start_offset":695,"end_offset":702},{"id":2949,"label":"activity","start_offset":673,"end_offset":687},{"id":2950,"label":"actor","start_offset":708,"end_offset":715},{"id":2951,"label":"activity","start_offset":723,"end_offset":757},{"id":2952,"label":"condition","start_offset":759,"end_offset":795},{"id":2953,"label":"actor","start_offset":801,"end_offset":818},{"id":2954,"label":"activity","start_offset":819,"end_offset":860},{"id":2955,"label":"actor","start_offset":867,"end_offset":894},{"id":2956,"label":"activity","start_offset":902,"end_offset":920},{"id":2957,"label":"activity","start_offset":925,"end_offset":978},{"id":2958,"label":"actor","start_offset":1023,"end_offset":1030},{"id":2962,"label":"actor","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1152},{"id":2963,"label":"activity","start_offset":1153,"end_offset":1178},{"id":2964,"label":"activity","start_offset":1030,"end_offset":1079},{"id":2965,"label":"actor","start_offset":1186,"end_offset":1196},{"id":2966,"label":"condition","start_offset":1214,"end_offset":1260},{"id":2967,"label":"actor","start_offset":1326,"end_offset":1333},{"id":2968,"label":"activity","start_offset":1266,"end_offset":1319},{"id":2969,"label":"condition","start_offset":1360,"end_offset":1431},{"id":2970,"label":"catch","start_offset":1437,"end_offset":1460},{"id":2971,"label":"condition","start_offset":1516,"end_offset":1573},{"id":2972,"label":"actor","start_offset":1579,"end_offset":1595},{"id":2973,"label":"actor","start_offset":1659,"end_offset":1677},{"id":2974,"label":"activity","start_offset":1596,"end_offset":1637},{"id":2975,"label":"actor","start_offset":1742,"end_offset":1751},{"id":2976,"label":"activity","start_offset":1752,"end_offset":1815},{"id":2977,"label":"actor","start_offset":1821,"end_offset":1830},{"id":2978,"label":"activity","start_offset":1831,"end_offset":1860},{"id":2979,"label":"activity","start_offset":1865,"end_offset":1929},{"id":2980,"label":"actor","start_offset":1999,"end_offset":2021},{"id":2981,"label":"activity","start_offset":2022,"end_offset":2078},{"id":2982,"label":"actor","start_offset":2173,"end_offset":2189},{"id":2983,"label":"activity","start_offset":2190,"end_offset":2239},{"id":2984,"label":"actor","start_offset":2255,"end_offset":2276},{"id":2985,"label":"catch","start_offset":2281,"end_offset":2315}],"relations":[{"id":1845,"from_id":2938,"to_id":2939,"type":"perform"},{"id":1846,"from_id":2940,"to_id":2941,"type":"perform"},{"id":1847,"from_id":2940,"to_id":2942,"type":"perform"},{"id":1848,"from_id":2940,"to_id":2943,"type":"perform"},{"id":1849,"from_id":2942,"to_id":2941,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1850,"from_id":2943,"to_id":2942,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1851,"from_id":2941,"to_id":2939,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1852,"from_id":2944,"to_id":2946,"type":"perform"},{"id":1853,"from_id":2949,"to_id":2948,"type":"perform"},{"id":1854,"from_id":2946,"to_id":2945,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1855,"from_id":2949,"to_id":2947,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1856,"from_id":2950,"to_id":2951,"type":"perform"},{"id":1857,"from_id":2953,"to_id":2954,"type":"perform"},{"id":1858,"from_id":2954,"to_id":2955,"type":"perform"},{"id":1859,"from_id":2954,"to_id":2952,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1860,"from_id":2955,"to_id":2956,"type":"perform"},{"id":1861,"from_id":2955,"to_id":2957,"type":"perform"},{"id":1862,"from_id":2958,"to_id":2964,"type":"perform"},{"id":1863,"from_id":2962,"to_id":2963,"type":"perform"},{"id":1864,"from_id":2963,"to_id":2965,"type":"perform"},{"id":1865,"from_id":2963,"to_id":2964,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1866,"from_id":2968,"to_id":2967,"type":"perform"},{"id":1867,"from_id":2968,"to_id":2966,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1868,"from_id":2970,"to_id":2969,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1869,"from_id":2972,"to_id":2974,"type":"perform"},{"id":1870,"from_id":2974,"to_id":2973,"type":"perform"},{"id":1871,"from_id":2974,"to_id":2971,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":1872,"from_id":2975,"to_id":2976,"type":"perform"},{"id":1873,"from_id":2977,"to_id":2978,"type":"perform"},{"id":1874,"from_id":2977,"to_id":2979,"type":"perform"},{"id":1875,"from_id":2978,"to_id":2976,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":1876,"from_id"

{"id":107,"text":"Customers drop off their prescriptions either in the drive-through counter or in the front counter of the pharmacy. Customers can request that their prescription be filled immediately. In this case, they have to wait between 15 minutes and one hour depending on the current workload. Most customers are not willing to wait that long, so they opt to nominate a pick- up time at a later point during the day. Generally, customers drop their prescriptions in the morning before going to work (or at lunchtime) and they come back to pick up the drugs after work, typically between 5pm and 6pm. When dropping their prescription, a technician asks the customer for the pick-up time and puts the prescription in a box labeled with the hour preceding the pick-up time. For example, if the customer asks to have the prescription be ready at 5pm, the technician will drop it in the box with the label 4pm (there is one box for each hour of the day). \nEvery hour, one of the pharmacy technicians picks up the prescriptions due to be filled in the current hour. The technician then enters the details of each prescription (e.g. doctor details, patient details and medication details) into the pharmacy system. As soon as the details of a prescription are entered, the pharmacy system performs an automated check called Drug Utilization Review (DUR). This check is meant to determine if the prescription contains any drugs that may be incompatible with other drugs that had been dispensed to the same customer in the past, or drugs that may be inappropriate for the customer taking into account the customer data maintained in the system (e.g. age). Any alarms raised during the automated DUR are reviewed by a pharmacist who performs a more thorough check. In some cases, the pharmacist even has to call the doctor who issued the prescription in order to confirm it. After the DUR, the system performs an insurance check in order to determine whether the customer’s insurance policy will pay for part or for the whole cost of the drugs. In most cases, the output of this check is that the insurance company would pay for a certain percentage of the costs, while the customer has to pay for the remaining part (also called the co-payment). The rules for determining how much the insurance company will pay and how much the customer has to pay are very complicated. Every insurance company has different rules. In some cases, the insurance policy does not cover one or several drugs in a prescription, but the drug in question can be replaced by another drug that is covered by the insurance policy. When such cases are detected, the pharmacist generally calls the doctor and\/or the patient to determine if it is possible to perform the drug replacement. Once the prescription passes the insurance check, it is assigned to a technician who collects the drugs from the shelves and puts them in a bag with the prescription stapled to it. After the technician has filled a given prescription, the bag is passed to the pharmacist who double-checks that the prescription has been filled correctly. After this quality check, the pharmacist seals the bag and puts it in the pick-up area. When a customer arrives to pick up a prescription, a technician retrieves the prescription and asks the customer for payment in case the drugs in the prescription are not (fully) covered by the customer’s

{"id":108,"text":"A purchase request is initiated when an employee at the company fills in and signs a form on paper. The purchase request includes information about the good to be purchased, the quantity, the desired delivery date, the approximate cost. The employee can also nominate a specific vendor. Employees often request quotes from vendors in order to get the required information. Completing the entire form can take a few days as the requestor often does not have the required data. The quote is attached to the purchase request. This completed request is signed by two supervisors. One supervisor has to provide a financial approval, while the other supervisor has to approve the necessity of the purchase and its conformance with company’s policy (e.g. does a requested software form part of the standard operating environment?). Collecting the signatures from the two supervisors takes on average five days. If it is urgent, the employee can hand-deliver the form, otherwise it is circulated via internal mail. A rejected purchase request is returned to the employee. Some employees make some minor modifications and try in a second attempt other supervisors in order to get approval.\nOnce a purchase request is approved, it is returned to the employee who initiated the pur- chase requisition. The employee then forwards the form to the Purchasing Department. Many employees make a copy of the form for their own record, in case the form gets lost. The central purchasing Department checks the completeness of the purchase request and returns it to the employee if it is incomplete.\nBased on attached quotes and other information, the purchasing Department enters the ap- proved purchase request into the company’s Enterprise System. If the employee has not nominated any vendors, a clerk at the purchasing Department will select one based either on the quotes attached to the purchase requisition, or based on the list of vendors (also called Master Vendor List) available in the company’s Enterprise System.\nSometimes the initial quote attached to the request has expired in the meantime. In this case, updated quote is requested from the corresponding vendor. In other cases, the vendor who submitted the quote is not recorded in the company’s Enterprise System. In this case, the purchasing Department should give preference to other vendors who are registered in the Enterprise System. If no such vendors are available or if the registered vendors offer higher prices than the one in the submitted quote, the purchasing Department can add the new vendor into the Enterprise System.\nWhen a vendor is selected, a purchase order is automatically generated by the Enterprise System. Then, a fax is generated and sent to the vendor. A copy of the purchase order is sent to Accounts Payable Office, which is part of the Financial Department, which uses an accounting system that is not integrated with the Enterprise System.\nThe goods are always delivered to the Goods Receipt Department. When a good is received, a clerk at this Department selects the corresponding purchase order in the Enterprise System. The clerk checks the quantity and quality and (in the positive case) generates a document called goods receipt form from the purchase order stored in the Enterprise System. The goods are then forwarded to the employee who initiated the purchase requisition. A printout of the goods receipt form is sent to the Accounts Payable Office. If there are any issues with the good, it is returned to the vendor and a paper-based note is sent to the Purchasing Department and to the Accounts Payable Office.\nThe vendor eventually sends the invoice directly to the Accounts Payable Office. A clerk at this office compares the purchase order, the goods receipt and the invoice—a task that is usually called “three-way matching”. Three-way matching can be quite time-consuming. If there are any discrepancies as it has to be investigated, if it was an error of the vendor or a data entry error. The duration of the payment process unfortunately takes sometimes so long that the discount for paying in a certain period expires. \nA bank transfer is finally triggered and a payment notice is sent to the vendor. Some vendors explicitly indicate in their invoice the bank account number where they want the transfer to occur. It may happen that the bank account number and name indicated in the invoice differs from the one recorded in the vendor database. Sometimes payments bounce back, in which case the vendor is contacted by phone, e-mail or postal mail. If new bank details are given, the transfer is attempted again.

{"id":110,"text":"A university provides education and services to its students. This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":3168,"label":"trigger","start_offset":79,"end_offset":118},{"id":3169,"label":"condition","start_offset":120,"end_offset":142},{"id":3170,"label":"actor","start_offset":151,"end_offset":158},{"id":3171,"label":"activity","start_offset":163,"end_offset":193},{"id":3172,"label":"activity","start_offset":195,"end_offset":222},{"id":3173,"label":"actor","start_offset":230,"end_offset":237},{"id":3175,"label":"activity","start_offset":241,"end_offset":251},{"id":3176,"label":"actor","start_offset":259,"end_offset":276},{"id":3178,"label":"activity","start_offset":341,"end_offset":421},{"id":3180,"label":"activity","start_offset":495,"end_offset":592},{"id":3181,"label":"actor","start_offset":594,"end_offset":614},{"id":3183,"label":"activity","start_offset":626,"end_offset":648},{"id":3184,"label":"condition","start_offset":649,"end_offset":685},{"id":3185,"label":"condition","start_offset":702,"end_offset":739},{"id":3188,"label":"actor","start_offset":741,"end_offset":786},{"id":3189,"label":"activity","start_offset":796,"end_offset":804},{"id":3190,"label":"activity","start_offset":825,"end_offset":885},{"id":3191,"label":"condition","start_offset":887,"end_offset":998},{"id":3192,"label":"actor","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1004},{"id":3193,"label":"activity","start_offset":1009,"end_offset":1035},{"id":3194,"label":"activity","start_offset":1052,"end_offset":1091},{"id":3195,"label":"activity","start_offset":1096,"end_offset":1180},{"id":3196,"label":"actor","start_offset":1186,"end_offset":1194},{"id":3197,"label":"activity","start_offset":1200,"end_offset":1242},{"id":3199,"label":"actor","start_offset":1339,"end_offset":1343},{"id":3200,"label":"activity","start_offset":1348,"end_offset":1375},{"id":3201,"label":"actor","start_offset":1380,"end_offset":1384},{"id":3202,"label":"activity","start_offset":1389,"end_offset":1423},{"id":3204,"label":"actor","start_offset":1431,"end_offset":1441},{"id":3205,"label":"activity","start_offset":1499,"end_offset":1539},{"id":3206,"label":"actor","start_offset":1545,"end_offset":1552},{"id":3207,"label":"actor","start_offset":1569,"end_offset":1577},{"id":3208,"label":"actor","start_offset":1583,"end_offset":1593},{"id":3212,"label":"activity","start_offset":1594,"end_offset":1604},{"id":3213,"label":"actor","start_offset":1605,"end_offset":1623},{"id":3214,"label":"actor","start_offset":1688,"end_offset":1696},{"id":3215,"label":"activity","start_offset":1707,"end_offset":1745},{"id":3216,"label":"actor","start_offset":1755,"end_offset":1769}],"relations":[{"id":2008,"from_id":3170,"to_id":3171,"type":"perform"},{"id":2009,"from_id":3171,"to_id":3169,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2010,"from_id":3173,"to_id":3175,"type":"perform"},{"id":2011,"from_id":3175,"to_id":3176,"type":"perform"},{"id":2012,"from_id":3175,"to_id":3172,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2013,"from_id":3172,"to_id":3171,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2014,"from_id":3180,"to_id":3178,"type":"union"},{"id":2015,"from_id":3181,"to_id":3183,"type":"perform"},{"id":2016,"from_id":3183,"to_id":3184,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2017,"from_id":3183,"to_id":3185,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2018,"from_id":3184,"to_id":3185,"type":"non_coexistence"},{"id":2019,"from_id":3188,"to_id":3189,"type":"perform"},{"id":2020,"from_id":3192,"to_id":3193,"type":"perform"},{"id":2021,"from_id":3190,"to_id":3189,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2022,"from_id":3193,"to_id":3191,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2023,"from_id":3194,"to_id":3193,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2024,"from_id":3195,"to_id":3194,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2025,"from_id":3196,"to_id":3197,"type":"perform"},{"id":2026,"from_id":3199,"to_id":3200,"type":"perform"},{"id":2027,"from_id":3201,"to_id":3202,"type":"perform"},{"id":2028,"from_id":3200,"to_id":3197,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2029,"from_id":3202,"to_id":3200,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2030,"from_id":3202,"to_id":3204,"type":"perform"},{"id":2031,"from_id":3205,"to_id":3206,"type":"perform"},{"id":2032,"from_id":3205,"to_id":3207,"type":"perform"},{"id":2033,"from_id":3207,"to_id":3206,"type":"union"},{"id":2034,"from_id":3208,"to_id":3212,"type":"perform"},{"id":2035,"from_id":3212,"to_id":3213,"type":"perform"},{"id":2036,"from_id":3214,"to_id":3215,"type":"perform"},{"id":2037,"from_id":3215,"to_id":3216,"type":"perform"},{"id":2038,"from_id":3215,"to_id":3212,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}

{"id":112,"text":"A consultancy firm provides consultancy, outsourcing, and interim management services. The firm considers acquisition of projects as part of those services. Acquisition can both be done for existing clients and for new clients, because it concerns acquisition of projects rather than clients. Acquisition is typically started at ‘networking events’ by partners of the consultancy firm. It is handled according to a fixed procedure, but no standard document is used. When a client shows interest in a consultancy service, an intake is done with the client. To maintain a long-term relationship with clients as much as possible, the firm will always try to establish a framework contract with new clients during the intake. For existing clients a framework contract does not have to be established. As another form of relationship management, regular meetings are held with existing clients. During these meetings the client’s organization is discussed with the client. This enables the client to decide whether additional work should be done to further improve the organization. At the same time this enables the firm to bring in additional assignments. The intake and the regular meetings happen according to the same form, on which an inventory of the client’s wishes can be made.\nFor consultancy and outsourcing services, a project team must be created directly after a project assignment was given to the consultancy firm. After a project team is created, there is a kick-off meeting with the client and after the kick-off meeting, the project is executed. The kick-off meeting is the same for each type of project, but the way in which the project is executed differs largely per type of service. At the end of the project there always is an evaluation meeting with the client as a means of quality control. The creation of the project team, the kick-off meeting, the execution of the project and the evaluation of the project happen according to a project plan.\nThe consultancy company has a services department, which takes care of market research for the consultants, manages the leasing of cars and provides secretary services.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":3230,"label":"condition","start_offset":466,"end_offset":519},{"id":3231,"label":"actor","start_offset":548,"end_offset":554},{"id":3232,"label":"trigger","start_offset":524,"end_offset":538},{"id":3233,"label":"actor","start_offset":631,"end_offset":635},{"id":3235,"label":"activity","start_offset":648,"end_offset":685},{"id":3236,"label":"actor","start_offset":691,"end_offset":702},{"id":3238,"label":"actor","start_offset":872,"end_offset":888},{"id":3239,"label":"activity","start_offset":841,"end_offset":866},{"id":3240,"label":"actor","start_offset":960,"end_offset":966},{"id":3241,"label":"activity","start_offset":916,"end_offset":950},{"id":3242,"label":"actor","start_offset":985,"end_offset":991},{"id":3246,"label":"activity","start_offset":995,"end_offset":1076},{"id":3247,"label":"actor","start_offset":1112,"end_offset":1116},{"id":3248,"label":"activity","start_offset":1120,"end_offset":1151},{"id":3249,"label":"actor","start_offset":1326,"end_offset":1338},{"id":3250,"label":"trigger","start_offset":1347,"end_offset":1390},{"id":3251,"label":"actor","start_offset":1408,"end_offset":1424},{"id":3252,"label":"actor","start_offset":1496,"end_offset":1502},{"id":3253,"label":"activity","start_offset":1470,"end_offset":1486},{"id":3254,"label":"activity","start_offset":1539,"end_offset":1558},{"id":3255,"label":"actor","start_offset":1774,"end_offset":1780},{"id":3256,"label":"catch","start_offset":1708,"end_offset":1764},{"id":3257,"label":"actor","start_offset":1997,"end_offset":2016},{"id":3258,"label":"activity","start_offset":2024,"end_offset":2053},{"id":3259,"label":"actor","start_offset":2062,"end_offset":2073},{"id":3260,"label":"activity","start_offset":2075,"end_offset":2102},{"id":3261,"label":"activity","start_offset":2107,"end_offset":2134}],"relations":[{"id":2048,"from_id":3232,"to_id":3231,"type":"perform"},{"id":2049,"from_id":3232,"to_id":3230,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2050,"from_id":3233,"to_id":3235,"type":"perform"},{"id":2051,"from_id":3235,"to_id":3236,"type":"perform"},{"id":2052,"from_id":3239,"to_id":3238,"type":"perform"},{"id":2053,"from_id":3241,"to_id":3240,"type":"perform"},{"id":2054,"from_id":3242,"to_id":3246,"type":"perform"},{"id":2055,"from_id":3241,"to_id":3239,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2056,"from_id":3246,"to_id":3241,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2057,"from_id":3247,"to_id":3248,"type":"perform"},{"id":2058,"from_id":3248,"to_id":3246,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2059,"from_id":3249,"to_id":3250,"type":"perform"},{"id":2060,"from_id":3250,"to_id":3251,"type":"perform"},{"id":2061,"from_id":3253,"to_id":3252,"type":"perform"},{"id":2062,"from_id":3253,"to_id":3250,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2063,"from_id":3254,"to_id":3253,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2064,"from_id":3256,"to_id":3254,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2065,"from_id":3256,"to_id":3255,"type":"perform"},{"id":2066,"from_id":3257,"to_id":3258,"type":"perform"},{"id":2067,"from_id":3258,"to_id":3259,"type":"perform"},{"id":2068,"from_id":3257,"to_id":3260,"type":"perform"},{"id":2069,"from_id":3257,"to_id":3261,"type":"perform"},{"id":2070,"from_id":3261,"to_id":3260,"type":"union"},{"id":2071,"from_id":3260,"to_id":3258,"type":"union"}]}

{"id":143,"text":"The mortgage application process starts with the receipt of a mortgage application from a client. When an application is sent in by the client to the broker, the broker may either deal with the application themselves, if the amount of the mortgage loan is within the mandate the broker has been given by BestLoans, or forward the application to BestLoans. If the broker deals with the application themselves, this results in either a rejection or an approval letter being sent back to the client. If the broker sends an approval letter, then it forwards the details of this application to BestLoans so that from there on the client can interact directly with BestLoans for the sake of disbursing the loan. In this case, BestLoans registers the application and sends an acknowledgment to the client.\nThe broker can only handle a given number of clients at a time. If the broker is not able to reply within one week, the client must contact BestLoans directly. In this case, a reduction on the interest rate is applied should the application be approved.\nIf BestLoans deals with the application directly, its mortgage department checks the credit of the client with the Bureau of Credit Registration. Moreover, if the loan amount is more than 90 % of the total cost of the house being purchased by the client, the mortgage department must request a mortgage insurance offer from the insurance department. After these interactions BestLoans either sends an approval letter or a rejection to the broker, which the broker then forwards to the client (this interaction may also happen directly between the mortgage department and the client if no broker is involved).\nAfter an approval letter has been submitted to the client, the client may either accept or reject the offer by notifying this directly to the mortgage department. If the mortgage department receives an acceptance notification, it writes a deed and sends it to an external notary for signature. The notary sends a copy of the signed deed to the mortgage department. Next, the insurance department starts an insurance contract for the mortgage. Finally, the mortgage department submits a disbursement request to the financial department. When this request has been handled, the financial department notifies the client directly.\nAny time during the application process, the client may inquire about the status of their application with the mortgage department or with the broker, depending on which entity is dealing with the client. Moreover, the client may request the cancellation of the application. In this case the mortgage department or the broker computes the application processing fees, which depend on how far the application process is, and communicates these to the client. The client may reply within two days with a cancellation confirmation, in which case the process is canceled, or with a cancellation withdrawal, in which case the process continues. If the process has to be canceled, BestLoans may need to first recall the loan (if the disbursement has been done), then annul the insurance contract (if an insurance contract has been drawn) and finally annul the deed (if a deed has been drawn).\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":3665,"label":"actor","start_offset":90,"end_offset":96},{"id":3666,"label":"trigger","start_offset":49,"end_offset":82},{"id":3667,"label":"condition","start_offset":98,"end_offset":156},{"id":3668,"label":"actor","start_offset":162,"end_offset":168},{"id":3669,"label":"activity","start_offset":180,"end_offset":216},{"id":3670,"label":"condition","start_offset":218,"end_offset":274},{"id":3671,"label":"actor","start_offset":279,"end_offset":285},{"id":3672,"label":"activity","start_offset":295,"end_offset":313},{"id":3673,"label":"activity","start_offset":318,"end_offset":354},{"id":3674,"label":"condition","start_offset":356,"end_offset":407},{"id":3676,"label":"activity","start_offset":414,"end_offset":481},{"id":3677,"label":"actor","start_offset":489,"end_offset":495},{"id":3678,"label":"condition","start_offset":497,"end_offset":535},{"id":3680,"label":"actor","start_offset":625,"end_offset":631},{"id":3681,"label":"activity","start_offset":636,"end_offset":704},{"id":3682,"label":"activity","start_offset":542,"end_offset":585},{"id":3683,"label":"actor","start_offset":589,"end_offset":598},{"id":3684,"label":"actor","start_offset":720,"end_offset":729},{"id":3685,"label":"activity","start_offset":730,"end_offset":755},{"id":3686,"label":"activity","start_offset":760,"end_offset":783},{"id":3687,"label":"actor","start_offset":791,"end_offset":797},{"id":3688,"label":"actor","start_offset":803,"end_offset":809},{"id":3689,"label":"activity","start_offset":819,"end_offset":861},{"id":3690,"label":"condition","start_offset":863,"end_offset":913},{"id":3691,"label":"actor","start_offset":919,"end_offset":925},{"id":3692,"label":"activity","start_offset":931,"end_offset":938},{"id":3693,"label":"actor","start_offset":939,"end_offset":948},{"id":3694,"label":"activity","start_offset":975,"end_offset":1016},{"id":3695,"label":"condition","start_offset":1017,"end_offset":1051},{"id":3696,"label":"condition","start_offset":1053,"end_offset":1101},{"id":3697,"label":"actor","start_offset":1107,"end_offset":1126},{"id":3698,"label":"activity","start_offset":1127,"end_offset":1144},{"id":3699,"label":"actor","start_offset":1152,"end_offset":1158},{"id":3700,"label":"condition","start_offset":1209,"end_offset":1306},{"id":3701,"label":"actor","start_offset":1312,"end_offset":1331},{"id":3702,"label":"activity","start_offset":1337,"end_offset":1371},{"id":3703,"label":"actor","start_offset":1381,"end_offset":1401},{"id":3704,"label":"actor","start_offset":1428,"end_offset":1437},{"id":3705,"label":"activity","start_offset":1445,"end_offset":1484},{"id":3706,"label":"actor","start_offset":1492,"end_offset":1498},{"id":3707,"label":"actor","start_offset":1510,"end_offset":1516},{"id":3708,"label":"activity","start_offset":1522,"end_offset":1530},{"id":3709,"label":"actor","start_offset":1538,"end_offset":1544},{"id":3710,"label":"actor","start_offset":1725,"end_offset":1731},{"id":3712,"label":"activity","start_offset":1743,"end_offset":1796},{"id":3713,"label":"actor","start_offset":1804,"end_offset":1823},{"id":3714,"label":"condition","start_offset":1825,"end_offset":1887},{"id":3715,"label":"activity","start_offset":1889,"end_offset":1905},{"id":3716,"label":"activity","start_offset":1910,"end_offset":1954},{"id":3717,"label":"actor","start_offset":1960,"end_offset":1966},{"id":3718,"label":"activity","start_offset":1967,"end_offset":1998},{"id":3719,"label":"actor","start_offset":2006,"end_offset":2025},{"id":3720,"label":"actor","start_offset":2037,"end_offset":2057},{"id":3721,"label":"activity","start_offset":2058,"end_offset":2086},{"id":3722,"label":"actor","start_offset":2095,"end_offset":2103},{"id":3723,"label":"actor","start_offset":2118,"end_offset":2137},{"id":3724,"label":"activity","start_offset":2138,"end_offset":2168},{"id":3725,"label":"actor","start_offset":2176,"end_offset":2196},{"id":3726,"label":"condition","start_offset":2198,"end_offset":2232},{"id":3727,"label":"actor","start_offset":2238,"end_offset":2258},{"id":3728,"label":"activity","start_offset":2259,"end_offset":2267},{"id":3729,"label":"actor","start_offset":2272,"end_offset":2278},{"id":3730,"label":"actor","start_offset":2334,"end_offset":2340},{"id":3731,"label":"activity","start_offset":2345,"end_offset":2390},{"id":3732,"label":"actor","start_offset":2400,"end_offset":2419},{"id":3733,"label":"actor","start_offset":2432,"end_offset":2438},{"id":3734,"label":"actor","start_offset":2508,"end_offset":2514},{"id":3735,"label":"catch","start_offset":2519,"end_offset":2562},{"id":3736,"label":"actor","start_offset":2581,"end_offset":2600},{"id":3737,"label":"actor","start_offset":2608,"end_offset":2614},{"id":3738,"label":"activity","start_offset":2615,"end_offset":2655},{"id":3739,"label":"actor","start_offset":2739,"end_offset":2745},{"id":3740,"label":"activity","start_offset":2713,"end_offset":2731},{"id":3741,"label":"actor","start_offset":2751,"end_offset":2757},{"id":3742,"label":"ca

Afterwards, the assistant registry manager within the registry performs a quality check.

{"id":150,"text":"The Smart Electronic Development Assessment System (Smart eDA) is a Queensland Government initiative aimed to provide an intuitive service for preparing, lodging and assessing land development applications. The land development business process starts with the receipt of a land development application from an applicant. Upon the receipt of a land development application, the assessment manager interacts with the cadastre to retrieve geographical information on the designated development area. This information is used to get an initial validation of the development proposal from the city council. If the plan is valid, the assessment manager sends the applicant a quote of the costs that will incur to process the application. These costs depend on the type of development plan (for residential\nor commercial purposes), and on the permit\/license that will be required for the plan to be approved. If the applicant accepts the quote, the assessment can start.\nThe assessment consists of a detailed analysis of the development plan. First, the assessment manager interacts with the Department of Main Roads (DMR) to check for conflicts with planned road development works. If there are conflicts, the application cannot proceed and must be rejected. In this case, the applicant is notified by the assessment manager. The applicant may wish to modify the development plan and re-submit it for assessment. In this case, the process is resumed from where it was interrupted.\nIf the development plan includes modifications to the natural environment, the assessment manager needs to request a land alteration permit to the Department of Natural Resources and Water (NRW). If the plan is for commercial purposes, additional fees will be applied to obtain this permit. Once the permit is granted, this is sent by NRW directly to the applicant. Likewise, if the designated development area is regulated by special environment protection laws, the assessment manager needs to request an environmental license to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Similarly, once the license is granted, this is sent by EPA directly to the applicant. Once the required permit and\/or license have been obtained, the assessment manager notifies the Applicant of the final approval.\nAt any time during this process, the applicant can track the progress of their application by\ninteracting directly with the assessment manager.\nAssessment manager, cadastre, DMR, NRW and EPA are all Queensland Government entities. In particular, NRW and EPA are part of the Department of Environment and Resource Management within the Queensland Government.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":3903,"label":"trigger","start_offset":261,"end_offset":302},{"id":3904,"label":"actor","start_offset":311,"end_offset":320},{"id":3905,"label":"actor","start_offset":378,"end_offset":396},{"id":3906,"label":"activity","start_offset":397,"end_offset":424},{"id":3907,"label":"condition","start_offset":603,"end_offset":623},{"id":3908,"label":"actor","start_offset":629,"end_offset":647},{"id":3909,"label":"activity","start_offset":648,"end_offset":653},{"id":3910,"label":"actor","start_offset":658,"end_offset":667},{"id":3911,"label":"condition","start_offset":903,"end_offset":937},{"id":3912,"label":"trigger","start_offset":943,"end_offset":963},{"id":3913,"label":"actor","start_offset":1048,"end_offset":1066},{"id":3914,"label":"activity","start_offset":1067,"end_offset":1139},{"id":3915,"label":"condition","start_offset":1177,"end_offset":1199},{"id":3916,"label":"activity","start_offset":1205,"end_offset":1231},{"id":3917,"label":"catch","start_offset":1241,"end_offset":1252},{"id":3918,"label":"actor","start_offset":1301,"end_offset":1319},{"id":3919,"label":"activity","start_offset":1272,"end_offset":1293},{"id":3920,"label":"actor","start_offset":1325,"end_offset":1334},{"id":3921,"label":"activity","start_offset":1339,"end_offset":1374},{"id":3922,"label":"activity","start_offset":1379,"end_offset":1406},{"id":3923,"label":"activity","start_offset":1426,"end_offset":1445},{"id":3924,"label":"condition","start_offset":1476,"end_offset":1549},{"id":3925,"label":"actor","start_offset":1555,"end_offset":1573},{"id":3926,"label":"activity","start_offset":1583,"end_offset":1615},{"id":3927,"label":"actor","start_offset":1623,"end_offset":1670},{"id":3928,"label":"condition","start_offset":1672,"end_offset":1710},{"id":3929,"label":"activity","start_offset":1712,"end_offset":1765},{"id":3930,"label":"actor","start_offset":1831,"end_offset":1840},{"id":3931,"label":"activity","start_offset":1795,"end_offset":1807},{"id":3932,"label":"actor","start_offset":1811,"end_offset":1814},{"id":3933,"label":"condition","start_offset":1852,"end_offset":1938},{"id":3934,"label":"actor","start_offset":1944,"end_offset":1962},{"id":3935,"label":"activity","start_offset":1972,"end_offset":2004},{"id":3936,"label":"actor","start_offset":2012,"end_offset":2049},{"id":3937,"label":"activity","start_offset":2091,"end_offset":2103},{"id":3938,"label":"actor","start_offset":2107,"end_offset":2110},{"id":3939,"label":"actor","start_offset":2127,"end_offset":2136},{"id":3940,"label":"condition","start_offset":2062,"end_offset":2089},{"id":3941,"label":"condition","start_offset":1767,"end_offset":1793},{"id":3942,"label":"condition","start_offset":2138,"end_offset":2196},{"id":3943,"label":"actor","start_offset":2202,"end_offset":2220},{"id":3944,"label":"activity","start_offset":2221,"end_offset":2229},{"id":3945,"label":"actor","start_offset":2234,"end_offset":2243},{"id":3946,"label":"actor","start_offset":2304,"end_offset":2313},{"id":3947,"label":"activity","start_offset":2318,"end_offset":2357},{"id":3948,"label":"actor","start_offset":2391,"end_offset":2409}],"relations":[{"id":2513,"from_id":3903,"to_id":3904,"type":"perform"},{"id":2514,"from_id":3905,"to_id":3906,"type":"perform"},{"id":2515,"from_id":3908,"to_id":3909,"type":"perform"},{"id":2516,"from_id":3909,"to_id":3910,"type":"perform"},{"id":2517,"from_id":3909,"to_id":3907,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2518,"from_id":3912,"to_id":3911,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2519,"from_id":3913,"to_id":3914,"type":"perform"},{"id":2520,"from_id":3916,"to_id":3915,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2521,"from_id":3917,"to_id":3916,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2522,"from_id":3919,"to_id":3918,"type":"perform"},{"id":2523,"from_id":3920,"to_id":3921,"type":"perform"},{"id":2524,"from_id":3922,"to_id":3921,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2525,"from_id":3923,"to_id":3922,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2526,"from_id":3925,"to_id":3926,"type":"perform"},{"id":2527,"from_id":3926,"to_id":3927,"type":"perform"},{"id":2528,"from_id":3926,"to_id":3924,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2529,"from_id":3929,"to_id":3928,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2530,"from_id":3931,"to_id":3932,"type":"perform"},{"id":2531,"from_id":3931,"to_id":3941,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2532,"from_id":3934,"to_id":3935,"type":"perform"},{"id":2533,"from_id":3935,"to_id":3936,"type":"perform"},{"id":2534,"from_id":3935,"to_id":3933,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2535,"from_id":3931,"to_id":3930,"type":"perform"},{"id":2536,"from_id":3937,"to_id":3938,"type":"perform"},{"id":2537,"from_id":3937,"to_id":3940,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2538,"from_id":3937,"to_id":3939,"type":"perform"},{"id":2539,"from_id":3943,"to_id":3944,"type":"perform"},{"id":2540,"from_id":3944,"to_id":3945,"type":"perform"},{"id":2541,"from_id":3944,"to_id":3942,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"}

{"id":151,"text":"The ordering business process starts with the receipt of a request for work order from a\ncustomer. Upon the receipt of this request, the ordering department of Sparks estimates the expected usage of supplies, parts and labor and prepares a quote with the estimated total cost for the maintenance activity. If the customer’s vehicle is insured, the ordering department interacts with the insurance department to retrieve the details of the customer’s insurance plan so that these can be attached to the quote. The ordering department then sends the quote to the customer, who can either accept or reject the quote by notifying the ordering department within five days. If the customer accepts the quote, the ordering department contacts the warehouse department to check if the required parts are in stock before scheduling an appointment with the customer. If some parts are not in stock, the ordering department orders the required parts by interacting with a certified reseller and waits for an order confirmation from the reseller, to be received within three days. If it is not received, the order department orders the parts again from a second reseller. If no reply is received from the second reseller too, the order department notifies the customer that the parts are not available and the process terminates. If the required parts are in stock or have been ordered, the ordering department interacts with an external garage to book a suitably equipped service bay and a suitably qualified mechanic to perform the work. A confirmation of the appointment is then sent by the garage to the order department which forwards the confirmation to the customer. The customer has one week to pay Sparks, otherwise the ordering department cancels the work order by sending a cancellation notice to both the service bay and the mechanic that have been booked for this order.

{"id":152,"text":"A build-to-order (BTO) process, also known as make-to-order process, is an “order-to-cash” process where the products to be sold are manufactured on the basis of a confirmed purchase order. In other words, the manufacturer does not maintain any ready-to-ship products in their stock. Instead, the products are manufactured on demand when the customer orders them.\nThis approach is used in the context of customized products, such as metallurgical products,\nwhere customers often submit orders for products with very specific requirements.\nWe consider a BTO process at a company called MetalWorks. The process starts when MetalWorks receives a purchase order (PO) from one of its customers. This PO is called the “customer PO”. The customer PO may contain one or multiple line items. Each line item refers to a different product.\nUpon receiving a customer PO, a sales officer checks the PO to determine if all the line items in the order can be produced within the timeframes indicated in the PO. As a result of this check, the sales officer may either confirm the customer PO or ask the customer to revise the terms of the PO (for example: change the delivery date to a later date). In some extreme cases, the sales officer may reject the PO, but this happens very rarely. If the customer is asked to revise the PO, the BTO process will be put in “stand-by” until the customer submits a revised PO. The sales officer will then check the revised PO and either accept it, reject it, or ask again the customer to make further changes.\nOnce a PO is confirmed, the sales officer creates one “work order” for each line item in the customer PO. In other words, one customer PO gives place to multiple work orders (one per line item). The work order is a document that allows employees at MetalWorks to keep track of the manufacturing of a product requested by a customer. \nIn order to manufacture a product, multiple raw materials are typically required. Some of these raw materials are maintained in stock in the warehouse of MetalWorks, but others need to be sourced from one or multiple suppliers. Accordingly, each work order is examined by a production engineer. The production engineer determines which raw materials are required in order to fulfill the work order. The production engineer annotates the work order with a list of required raw materials. Each raw material listed in the work order is later checked by a procurement officer. The procurement officer determines whether the required raw material is available in stock, or it has to be ordered. If the material has to be ordered, the procurement officer selects a suitable supplier for the raw material and sends a PO to the selected supplier. This “PO for a raw material” is called a “material PO”, and it is different\nfrom the customer PO. A material PO is a PO sent by MetalWorks to one of its suppliers, whereas a customer PO is a PO received by MetalWorks from one of its customers.\nOnce all materials required to fulfill a work order are available, the production can start. The responsibility for the production of a work order is assigned to the same production engineer who previously examined the work order. The production engineer is responsible for scheduling the production. Once the product has been manufactured, it is checked by a quality inspector. Sometimes, the quality inspector finds a defect in the product and reports it to the production engineer. The production engineer then decides whether: (i) the product should undergo a minor fix; or (ii) the product should be discarded and manufactured again.\nOnce the production has completed, the product is shipped to the customer. There is no need to wait until all the line items requested in a customer PO are ready before shipping them. As soon as a product is ready, it can be shipped to the corresponding customer.\nAt any point in time (before the shipment of the product), the customer may send a “cancel\norder” message for a given PO. When this happens, the sales officer determines if the order can still be canceled, and if so, whether or not the customer should pay a penalty. If the order can be canceled without penalty, all the work related to that order is stopped and the customer is notified that the cancellation has been successful. If the customer needs to pay a penalty, the sales officer first asks the customer if they accept to pay the cancellation penalty.

{"id":153,"text":"A travel agency has recently lost several medium-sized and large corporate customers due to complaints about poor customer service. The management team of the travel agency decided to appoint a team of analysts to address this problem. The team gathered data by conducting interviews and surveys with current and past corporate customers and also by gathering customer feedback data that the travel agency has recorded over time. About 2 % of customers complained about errors that had been made in their bookings. In one occasion, a customer had requested a change to a flight booking. The travel agent wrote an e-mail to the customer suggesting that the change had been made and attached a modified travel itinerary. However, it later turned out that the modified booking had not been confirmed in the flight reservation system. As a result, the customer was not allowed to board the flight and this led to a series of severe inconveniences for the customer. Similar problems had occurred when booking a flight initially: the customer had asked for certain dates, but the flight tickets had been issued for different dates. Additionally, customers complained of the long times it took to get responses to their requests for quotes and itineraries. In most cases, employees of the travel agency replied to requests for quotes within 2–4 working hours, but in the case of some complicated itinerary requests (about 10 % of the requests), it took them up to 2 days. Finally, about 5 % of customers also complained that the travel agents did not find the best flight connections and prices for them. These customers essentially stated that they had found better itineraries and prices on the Web by searching by themselves.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":4096,"label":"actor","start_offset":136,"end_offset":172},{"id":4097,"label":"trigger","start_offset":173,"end_offset":191},{"id":4098,"label":"actor","start_offset":194,"end_offset":210},{"id":4099,"label":"actor","start_offset":240,"end_offset":244},{"id":4100,"label":"activity","start_offset":245,"end_offset":258},{"id":4102,"label":"actor","start_offset":318,"end_offset":337},{"id":4103,"label":"activity","start_offset":350,"end_offset":382},{"id":4104,"label":"actor","start_offset":443,"end_offset":452},{"id":4105,"label":"activity","start_offset":453,"end_offset":513},{"id":4106,"label":"actor","start_offset":534,"end_offset":542},{"id":4107,"label":"activity","start_offset":547,"end_offset":585},{"id":4108,"label":"actor","start_offset":591,"end_offset":603},{"id":4109,"label":"activity","start_offset":604,"end_offset":619},{"id":4110,"label":"actor","start_offset":627,"end_offset":635},{"id":4111,"label":"actor","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1036},{"id":4112,"label":"activity","start_offset":1041,"end_offset":1064},{"id":4113,"label":"actor","start_offset":1140,"end_offset":1149},{"id":4114,"label":"activity","start_offset":1150,"end_offset":1203},{"id":4115,"label":"actor","start_offset":1487,"end_offset":1496},{"id":4116,"label":"activity","start_offset":1502,"end_offset":1596},{"id":4118,"label":"actor","start_offset":1638,"end_offset":1642},{"id":4119,"label":"activity","start_offset":1647,"end_offset":1693}],"relations":[{"id":2640,"from_id":4096,"to_id":4097,"type":"perform"},{"id":2641,"from_id":4097,"to_id":4098,"type":"perform"},{"id":2642,"from_id":4099,"to_id":4100,"type":"perform"},{"id":2643,"from_id":4102,"to_id":4103,"type":"perform"},{"id":2644,"from_id":4104,"to_id":4105,"type":"perform"},{"id":2645,"from_id":4106,"to_id":4107,"type":"perform"},{"id":2646,"from_id":4108,"to_id":4109,"type":"perform"},{"id":2647,"from_id":4109,"to_id":4110,"type":"perform"},{"id":2648,"from_id":4111,"to_id":4112,"type":"perform"},{"id":2649,"from_id":4113,"to_id":4114,"type":"perform"},{"id":2650,"from_id":4115,"to_id":4116,"type":"perform"},{"id":2651,"from_id":4118,"to_id":4119,"type":"perform"},{"id":2652,"from_id":4100,"to_id":4097,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2653,"from_id":4103,"to_id":4100,"type":"union"},{"id":2654,"from_id":4105,"to_id":4103,"type":"union"},{"id":2655,"from_id":4107,"to_id":4105,"type":"union"},{"id":2656,"from_id":4109,"to_id":4107,"type":"union"},{"id":2657,"from_id":4112,"to_id":4109,"type":"union"},{"id":2658,"from_id":4114,"to_id":4112,"type":"union"},{"id":2659,"from_id":4116,"to_id":4114,"type":"union"},{"id":2660,"from_id":4119,"to_id":4116,"type":"union"}]}

{"id":155,"text":"A client calls the help desk or sends an e-mail in order to make a request. The help desk is staffed with five “Level-1” support staff who, typically, are junior people with less than 12 months experience, but are capable of resolving known problems and simple requests. The hourly cost of a Level-1 staff member is € 40.\nWhen the Level-1 employee does not know the resolution to a request, the request is forwarded to a more experienced “Level-2” support staff. There are three Level-2 staff members and their hourly cost is € 60. When a Level-2 employee receives a new request, they evaluate it in order to assign a priority level. The job tracking system will later assign the request to the same or to another Level-2 staff depending on the assigned priority level and the backlog of requests.\nOnce the request is assigned to a Level-2 staff member, the request is researched by the Level-2 employee and a resolution is developed and sent back to the Level-1 employee. Eventually, the Level-1 employee forwards the resolution to the client who tests the resolution. The client notifies the outcome of the test to the Level-1 employee via e-mail. If the client states that the request is fixed, it is marked as complete and the process ends. If the request is not fixed, it is resent to Level-2 support for further action and goes through the process again.\nRequests are registered in a job tracking system. The job tracking system allows help desk employees to record the details of the request, the priority level and the name of the client who generated the request. When a request is registered, it is marked as “open”. When it is moved to level 2, it is marked as “forwarded to level 2” and when the resolution is sent back to “Level 1” the request is marked as “returned to level 1”. Finally, when a request is resolved, it is marked as “closed”. Every request has a unique identifier. When a request is registered, the job tracking system sends an e-mail to the client. The e-mail includes a “request reference number” that the client needs to quote when asking questions about the request.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":4129,"label":"actor","start_offset":2,"end_offset":8},{"id":4130,"label":"trigger","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14},{"id":4131,"label":"actor","start_offset":19,"end_offset":28},{"id":4132,"label":"activity","start_offset":32,"end_offset":47},{"id":4134,"label":"activity","start_offset":214,"end_offset":269},{"id":4135,"label":"actor","start_offset":155,"end_offset":168},{"id":4137,"label":"condition","start_offset":322,"end_offset":389},{"id":4138,"label":"actor","start_offset":439,"end_offset":461},{"id":4139,"label":"activity","start_offset":395,"end_offset":415},{"id":4140,"label":"condition","start_offset":532,"end_offset":578},{"id":4141,"label":"actor","start_offset":580,"end_offset":584},{"id":4142,"label":"activity","start_offset":585,"end_offset":632},{"id":4143,"label":"actor","start_offset":638,"end_offset":657},{"id":4144,"label":"activity","start_offset":669,"end_offset":687},{"id":4145,"label":"actor","start_offset":714,"end_offset":727},{"id":4146,"label":"actor","start_offset":887,"end_offset":903},{"id":4147,"label":"activity","start_offset":858,"end_offset":879},{"id":4148,"label":"actor","start_offset":955,"end_offset":971},{"id":4149,"label":"activity","start_offset":910,"end_offset":933},{"id":4150,"label":"activity","start_offset":938,"end_offset":947},{"id":4151,"label":"actor","start_offset":989,"end_offset":1005},{"id":4152,"label":"activity","start_offset":1006,"end_offset":1029},{"id":4153,"label":"actor","start_offset":1037,"end_offset":1043},{"id":4154,"label":"activity","start_offset":1048,"end_offset":1068},{"id":4155,"label":"actor","start_offset":1074,"end_offset":1080},{"id":4156,"label":"activity","start_offset":1081,"end_offset":1113},{"id":4157,"label":"actor","start_offset":1121,"end_offset":1137},{"id":4158,"label":"condition","start_offset":1150,"end_offset":1196},{"id":4159,"label":"activity","start_offset":1198,"end_offset":1222},{"id":4160,"label":"condition","start_offset":1245,"end_offset":1272},{"id":4161,"label":"activity","start_offset":1274,"end_offset":1286},{"id":4162,"label":"actor","start_offset":1289,"end_offset":1305},{"id":4163,"label":"actor","start_offset":1390,"end_offset":1409},{"id":4164,"label":"activity","start_offset":1361,"end_offset":1384},{"id":4165,"label":"actor","start_offset":1415,"end_offset":1434},{"id":4166,"label":"actor","start_offset":1442,"end_offset":1461},{"id":4168,"label":"activity","start_offset":1465,"end_offset":1545},{"id":4169,"label":"condition","start_offset":1573,"end_offset":1601},{"id":4170,"label":"activity","start_offset":1603,"end_offset":1625},{"id":4171,"label":"condition","start_offset":1627,"end_offset":1654},{"id":4172,"label":"activity","start_offset":1656,"end_offset":1694},{"id":4173,"label":"condition","start_offset":1699,"end_offset":1744},{"id":4174,"label":"activity","start_offset":1749,"end_offset":1791},{"id":4175,"label":"condition","start_offset":1802,"end_offset":1828},{"id":4176,"label":"catch","start_offset":1830,"end_offset":1854},{"id":4177,"label":"condition","start_offset":1895,"end_offset":1923},{"id":4178,"label":"actor","start_offset":1929,"end_offset":1948},{"id":4179,"label":"activity","start_offset":1949,"end_offset":1964},{"id":4180,"label":"actor","start_offset":1972,"end_offset":1978},{"id":4411,"label":"catch","start_offset":1231,"end_offset":1243}],"relations":[{"id":2670,"from_id":4129,"to_id":4130,"type":"perform"},{"id":2671,"from_id":4130,"to_id":4131,"type":"perform"},{"id":2672,"from_id":4129,"to_id":4132,"type":"perform"},{"id":2673,"from_id":4132,"to_id":4130,"type":"non_coexistence"},{"id":2674,"from_id":4135,"to_id":4134,"type":"perform"},{"id":2675,"from_id":4139,"to_id":4137,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2676,"from_id":4139,"to_id":4138,"type":"perform"},{"id":2677,"from_id":4141,"to_id":4142,"type":"perform"},{"id":2678,"from_id":4142,"to_id":4140,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2679,"from_id":4143,"to_id":4144,"type":"perform"},{"id":2680,"from_id":4144,"to_id":4145,"type":"perform"},{"id":2681,"from_id":4147,"to_id":4146,"type":"perform"},{"id":2682,"from_id":4147,"to_id":4144,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2683,"from_id":4146,"to_id":4149,"type":"perform"},{"id":2684,"from_id":4150,"to_id":4148,"type":"perform"},{"id":2685,"from_id":4150,"to_id":4149,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2686,"from_id":4151,"to_id":4152,"type":"perform"},{"id":2687,"from_id":4152,"to_id":4153,"type":"perform"},{"id":2688,"from_id":4153,"to_id":4154,"type":"perform"},{"id":2689,"from_id":4155,"to_id":4156,"type":"perform"},{"id":2690,"from_id":4156,"to_id":4157,"type":"perform"},{"id":2691,"from_id":4159,"to_id":4158,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":2692,"from_id":4154,"to_id":4152,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2693,"from_id":4156,"to_id":4154,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":2694,"from_id":4161,"to_id":4162,"type":"perform"},{"id":2695,"from_id":4161,"to_id":4160,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"i

{"id":162,"text":"The Order Registration Process is a collaboration between the Customer and ACME with the aim of creating a new purchase order for a service or product. In ACME's Sales Department, the process involves the following roles: Sales Attendant (SA), Sales Manager (SM), and Inventory Manager (IM).\n\nThe process starts with the need for the Customer to acquire a product or service. The Customer prepares their order and sends it to ACME through a Message. Subsequently, the Customer waits for ACME's response, which can be: a quotation message or a message stating that the product\/service is unavailable. If the customer does not receive any message by the end of the 5-day period, they give up waiting, and the process is terminated. If the customer receives a quotation message, they evaluate it, either approving or rejecting it. If the quotation is approved, the customer sends a confirmation message to ACME, and the process ends. If the customer receives a message stating that the product is unavailable, they evaluate the situation and decide whether to resubmit the order (going back to the preparation task) or end the process.\n\nWhen the order reaches ACME, it is received by the Sales Attendant (SA). The SA registers the order and proceeds to analyze it. If the order is for a product, the availability in the inventory is checked by the SA. If the product is available, a quotation is created. The quotation is sent to the Sales Manager (SM) for approval. The SM analyzes the quotation, and if approved, sends an approval message to the SA. Otherwise, they update the quotation and send a message with the new quotation back to the SA. Upon receiving the quotation from the SM, the SA forwards it to the Customer and awaits their approval. If the customer does not confirm within 10 days, the quotation is archived, and the process ends. Otherwise, the SA forwards the approved quotation to the Inventory Manager and ends the process. If the product is unavailable, the SA forwards the order to the Inventory Manager (IM). The IM checks if the product can be acquired. In this case, the IM revises the quotation and sends it to the SA, who in turn forwards it to the customer and waits for confirmation. If acquiring the product is not possible, the IM sends a message stating that the Product\/Service is unavailable to the customer, and the process ends.\n\nIf the order is for a service, the Sales Attendant (SA) forwards it to the Sales Manager (SM). The SM analyzes the order and, if it can be fulfilled, provides a quotation and sends it to the SA, who in turn forwards it to the customer, following the same procedure as with a product. If the order cannot be fulfilled, the SM sends a message stating that the Product\/Service is unavailable to the customer, and the process

{"id":163,"text":"The Order Cancellation Process is a collaboration between the Customer and ACME with the aim of canceling a purchase order for a service or product. In ACME, the process involves the following roles: Sales Attendant (SA), Sales Manager (SM), and Inventory Manager (IM).\n\nThe process starts with the need to cancel an order placed by the Customer. The Customer retrieves the order details from their database, prepares a cancellation form, and sends it to ACME. Subsequently, the customer waits for the company's response, which can be either \"Order Canceled\" or \"Request cannot be fulfilled,\" along with the reason. If the customer does not receive any response within 10 days, they resend the cancellation form and return to the sending task. If they receive the \"Order Canceled\" message, the Customer records the cancellation, and the process ends. If the \"Request cannot be fulfilled\" message is received, the customer evaluates the reason for non-cancellation. Depending on the evaluation, they either resubmit the cancellation request or simply end the process.\n\nThe Cancellation requests are received by ACME's Sales Attendant (SA). Upon receiving a cancellation request, the SA records it and forwards it to the Sales Manager (SM\n\n). The SM reviews the cancellation request. If approved, they send the \"Order Canceled\" message to the Customer, and if it's an order for a product, they notify the Inventory Manager (IM) of the cancellation through a signaling event. If not approved, they generate a document stating the reason for non-cancellation and send it to the customer along with the \"Request cannot be fulfilled\" message.

{"id":165,"text":"The Collaborative Order Fulfillment and Dispatch process aims to deliver the product\/service to the Customer. This process also involves billing and collecting payment for the order. In ACME, the process involves the following roles: Order Provider (OP), Inventory Manager (IM), and Production Manager (PM).\n\nThe process initiates whenever there are orders for fulfillment. An event indicating this condition occurs (process start event), and the order provider starts the work by checking if it is an order for a service or a product. If the order is for a product, the availability in the inventory is checked by the OP. If the product is not available in the inventory, the OP sends a request to the Inventory Manager (IM) to procure the product and waits for fulfillment. The IM then forwards a production request to the Production Manager (PM) and notifies the OP that the product has been requested for production. Subsequently, the Production Manager waits for the production process to be completed. After the product is manufactured, the PM sends the products to the Inventory Manager. Once the product is available in the inventory, the IM forwards it to the Order Provider (OP), who proceeds with the billing process for the product and awaits payment. As soon as the Customer sends the payment, the product is dispatched, and the process ends.\n\nIf the order is for a service, the Order Provider (OP) sends an agenda for scheduling the service to the Customer, asking them to choose a date for the service execution. The Customer reviews the received agenda and responds with the scheduled date for the service. The order provider forwards the scheduling to the Production Manager and awaits the execution of the service. The Production Manager waits until the scheduled date and then executes the service. After the service is completed, the Production Manager notifies the Order Provider that the service has been executed. Upon receiving the notification of service completion, the OP proceeds with the billing process for the service and awaits payment. As soon as the Customer sends the payment, the service is executed, and the process

After the request for opening the position, the HR department analyzes and evaluates whether the recruitment process will be internal, in which case existing employees within the organization are identified. Employees who wish to change positions are assessed to see if they fit the desired profile. If no employee within the organization matches the vacancy, it is opened to external candidates.\n\nIn this case, HR creates the job description, selects the locations where the vacancy will be advertised (employment agency, social media, company's talent pool), and receives resumes from interested candidates. A screening process is then conducted to shortlist the professionals who best match the vacancy and company requirements. After the screening, the company contacts all pre-selected candidates and schedules job interviews. After scheduling the interviews, the recruiter conducts the personal interviews, confirming the information provided in the resumes. After the interviews are conducted, HR and the candidates evaluate which candidate best fits the company's needs. Once a candidate is selected, the hiring process concludes. If no candidate is selected, the HR Manager (HRM) informs the Area Manager (AM) that there were no selected candidates, and the process ends.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":4555,"label":"actor","start_offset":178,"end_offset":190},{"id":4556,"label":"trigger","start_offset":224,"end_offset":228},{"id":4557,"label":"actor","start_offset":232,"end_offset":240},{"id":4558,"label":"actor","start_offset":351,"end_offset":364},{"id":4559,"label":"activity","start_offset":365,"end_offset":373},{"id":4560,"label":"activity","start_offset":378,"end_offset":436},{"id":4561,"label":"actor","start_offset":511,"end_offset":520},{"id":4562,"label":"activity","start_offset":524,"end_offset":562},{"id":4563,"label":"condition","start_offset":570,"end_offset":601},{"id":4564,"label":"condition","start_offset":603,"end_offset":661},{"id":4565,"label":"activity","start_offset":663,"end_offset":675},{"id":4566,"label":"actor","start_offset":679,"end_offset":698},{"id":4567,"label":"actor","start_offset":715,"end_offset":717},{"id":4568,"label":"activity","start_offset":718,"end_offset":745},{"id":4569,"label":"activity","start_offset":747,"end_offset":805},{"id":4570,"label":"activity","start_offset":868,"end_offset":884},{"id":4571,"label":"actor","start_offset":901,"end_offset":911},{"id":4572,"label":"activity","start_offset":915,"end_offset":950},{"id":4573,"label":"actor","start_offset":968,"end_offset":981},{"id":4574,"label":"actor","start_offset":1060,"end_offset":1067},{"id":4575,"label":"activity","start_offset":1068,"end_offset":1076},{"id":4576,"label":"actor","start_offset":1081,"end_offset":1104},{"id":4577,"label":"activity","start_offset":1109,"end_offset":1133},{"id":4578,"label":"actor","start_offset":1172,"end_offset":1181},{"id":4579,"label":"activity","start_offset":1182,"end_offset":1214},{"id":4580,"label":"activity","start_offset":1216,"end_offset":1266},{"id":4581,"label":"actor","start_offset":1304,"end_offset":1306},{"id":4582,"label":"actor","start_offset":1315,"end_offset":1325},{"id":4583,"label":"activity","start_offset":1326,"end_offset":1380},{"id":4584,"label":"condition","start_offset":1382,"end_offset":1410},{"id":4585,"label":"catch","start_offset":1416,"end_offset":1440},{"id":4586,"label":"condition","start_offset":1442,"end_offset":1469},{"id":4587,"label":"actor","start_offset":1474,"end_offset":1491},{"id":4588,"label":"activity","start_offset":1492,"end_offset":1499},{"id":4589,"label":"actor","start_offset":1504,"end_offset":1521},{"id":4591,"label":"catch","start_offset":1570,"end_offset":1582}],"relations":[{"id":3008,"from_id":4555,"to_id":4556,"type":"perform"},{"id":3009,"from_id":4556,"to_id":4557,"type":"perform"},{"id":3010,"from_id":4558,"to_id":4559,"type":"perform"},{"id":3011,"from_id":4558,"to_id":4560,"type":"perform"},{"id":3012,"from_id":4560,"to_id":4559,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3013,"from_id":4561,"to_id":4562,"type":"perform"},{"id":3014,"from_id":4562,"to_id":4563,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3015,"from_id":4565,"to_id":4566,"type":"perform"},{"id":3016,"from_id":4565,"to_id":4564,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3017,"from_id":4567,"to_id":4568,"type":"perform"},{"id":3018,"from_id":4567,"to_id":4569,"type":"perform"},{"id":3019,"from_id":4569,"to_id":4568,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3020,"from_id":4567,"to_id":4570,"type":"perform"},{"id":3021,"from_id":4570,"to_id":4571,"type":"perform"},{"id":3022,"from_id":4570,"to_id":4569,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3023,"from_id":4572,"to_id":4573,"type":"perform"},{"id":3024,"from_id":4574,"to_id":4575,"type":"perform"},{"id":3025,"from_id":4575,"to_id":4576,"type":"perform"},{"id":3026,"from_id":4575,"to_id":4572,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3027,"from_id":4577,"to_id":4575,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3028,"from_id":4578,"to_id":4579,"type":"perform"},{"id":3029,"from_id":4578,"to_id":4580,"type":"perform"},{"id":3030,"from_id":4580,"to_id":4579,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3031,"from_id":4581,"to_id":4583,"type":"perform"},{"id":3032,"from_id":4582,"to_id":4583,"type":"perform"},{"id":3033,"from_id":4582,"to_id":4581,"type":"union"},{"id":3034,"from_id":4585,"to_id":4584,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3035,"from_id":4587,"to_id":4588,"type":"perform"},{"id":3036,"from_id":4588,"to_id":4589,"type":"perform"},{"id":3037,"from_id":4588,"to_id":4586,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3038,"from_id":4591,"to_id":4588,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}

{"id":170,"text":"A travel agency wishes to establish a reservation service for its clients. The service is triggered by a request received from the client and can return two different messages: an unavailability notification or a confirmation. Upon receiving the request, the business process of the service begins and then analyzes the request. If, for certain reasons, the request needs to be handled manually by an employee (for example, group trips), a subprocess for manual handling will be activated. Otherwise, the process enters a transactional subprocess, where a bus reservation and a hotel reservation occur in parallel. However, if either of these fails, the transaction is canceled and the subprocess ends with an error. After the cancellation, in the main process, a log message is recorded, and the unavailability message is sent to the client. If both reservations are successful, an attraction is booked by the Attraction subprocess, which interacts with an external service for attraction reservations. If the attraction reservation service does not respond in time, the attraction reservation subprocess is canceled (ends with an error), and a manual attraction reservation subprocess is executed. The manual attraction reservation always results in a successful reservation. After the reservation is successfully made, a confirmation message is sent to the client.","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":4673,"label":"trigger","start_offset":105,"end_offset":121},{"id":4674,"label":"actor","start_offset":131,"end_offset":137},{"id":4675,"label":"activity","start_offset":307,"end_offset":327},{"id":4676,"label":"condition","start_offset":329,"end_offset":352},{"id":4677,"label":"activity","start_offset":358,"end_offset":394},{"id":4678,"label":"actor","start_offset":401,"end_offset":409},{"id":4679,"label":"condition","start_offset":490,"end_offset":499},{"id":4680,"label":"activity","start_offset":505,"end_offset":546},{"id":4681,"label":"activity","start_offset":556,"end_offset":571},{"id":4682,"label":"activity","start_offset":578,"end_offset":595},{"id":4683,"label":"condition","start_offset":624,"end_offset":648},{"id":4685,"label":"activity","start_offset":654,"end_offset":677},{"id":4686,"label":"catch","start_offset":686,"end_offset":715},{"id":4687,"label":"activity","start_offset":764,"end_offset":787},{"id":4688,"label":"activity","start_offset":797,"end_offset":827},{"id":4689,"label":"actor","start_offset":835,"end_offset":841},{"id":4690,"label":"condition","start_offset":843,"end_offset":878},{"id":4691,"label":"activity","start_offset":880,"end_offset":903},{"id":4692,"label":"actor","start_offset":911,"end_offset":932},{"id":4693,"label":"condition","start_offset":1004,"end_offset":1066},{"id":4694,"label":"catch","start_offset":1072,"end_offset":1117},{"id":4695,"label":"activity","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1198},{"id":4696,"label":"actor","start_offset":1204,"end_offset":1233},{"id":4697,"label":"activity","start_offset":1241,"end_offset":1276},{"id":4698,"label":"activity","start_offset":1324,"end_offset":1352},{"id":4699,"label":"actor","start_offset":1360,"end_offset":1366}],"relations":[{"id":3103,"from_id":4673,"to_id":4674,"type":"perform"},{"id":3104,"from_id":4675,"to_id":4673,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3105,"from_id":4677,"to_id":4676,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3106,"from_id":4677,"to_id":4678,"type":"perform"},{"id":3107,"from_id":4680,"to_id":4679,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3108,"from_id":4681,"to_id":4680,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3110,"from_id":4685,"to_id":4683,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3111,"from_id":4686,"to_id":4685,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3112,"from_id":4688,"to_id":4689,"type":"perform"},{"id":3113,"from_id":4688,"to_id":4687,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3114,"from_id":4691,"to_id":4690,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3115,"from_id":4691,"to_id":4692,"type":"perform"},{"id":3116,"from_id":4694,"to_id":4693,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3117,"from_id":4695,"to_id":4694,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3118,"from_id":4696,"to_id":4697,"type":"perform"},{"id":3119,"from_id":4698,"to_id":4697,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3120,"from_id":4698,"to_id":4699,"type":"perform"},{"id":3121,"from_id":4682,"to_id":4681,"type":"union"}]}
{"id":171,"text":"A client wishes to establish an online meal service and requests the modeling of its fundamental processes, as described below:\nThe service should be available on the Internet and provide options to: (1) create or modify customer profiles, (2) select and remove items from a shopping cart, and (3) complete the purchase (checkout). Additionally, the definition of the (4) Delivery Process is requested.\nHere is the description provided by the client:\nThe products are divided into two types: cold and hot. All cold products are simply taken from the warehouse, while hot products are prepared half an hour before the start of delivery. After the customer has chosen various cold and hot products, they can proceed to finalize the purchase. The checkout requires the selection of 1) a customer profile, 2) the delivery time, and 3) the credit card number, which is debited from the bank. If the customer does not have a profile, they are invited to create a new one. After the customer's profile is selected or created, the customer must confirm their information or may even update it. Once the checkout is completed, the order is saved, and the customer receives a confirmation email. The customer should be able to cancel orders at any time up to one hour before the delivery time. The meal service should frequently check open orders to prepare hot products in time for delivery. After all cold and hot items are collected or prepared, they are delivered to the customer. The day after the delivery, an email is sent to the customer requesting feedback on the quality of the service and the items.\n","Comments":[],"entities":[{"id":4700,"label":"trigger","start_offset":132,"end_offset":175},{"id":4701,"label":"activity","start_offset":204,"end_offset":238},{"id":4702,"label":"activity","start_offset":244,"end_offset":288},{"id":4703,"label":"activity","start_offset":298,"end_offset":330},{"id":4704,"label":"activity","start_offset":372,"end_offset":401},{"id":4706,"label":"actor","start_offset":646,"end_offset":654},{"id":4707,"label":"activity","start_offset":659,"end_offset":695},{"id":4708,"label":"actor","start_offset":697,"end_offset":701},{"id":4709,"label":"activity","start_offset":706,"end_offset":738},{"id":4710,"label":"actor","start_offset":1023,"end_offset":1031},{"id":4711,"label":"condition","start_offset":887,"end_offset":926},{"id":4712,"label":"actor","start_offset":928,"end_offset":932},{"id":4713,"label":"activity","start_offset":936,"end_offset":964},{"id":4714,"label":"activity","start_offset":1037,"end_offset":1062},{"id":4715,"label":"activity","start_offset":1075,"end_offset":1084},{"id":4716,"label":"condition","start_offset":1086,"end_offset":1116},{"id":4717,"label":"activity","start_offset":1122,"end_offset":1136},{"id":4718,"label":"actor","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1154},{"id":4719,"label":"activity","start_offset":1155,"end_offset":1184},{"id":4720,"label":"actor","start_offset":1190,"end_offset":1198},{"id":4721,"label":"activity","start_offset":1209,"end_offset":1245},{"id":4723,"label":"actor","start_offset":1439,"end_offset":1443},{"id":4724,"label":"activity","start_offset":1288,"end_offset":1336},{"id":4725,"label":"activity","start_offset":1448,"end_offset":1457},{"id":4726,"label":"actor","start_offset":1465,"end_offset":1473},{"id":4727,"label":"activity","start_offset":1506,"end_offset":1519},{"id":4728,"label":"actor","start_offset":1527,"end_offset":1535}],"relations":[{"id":3122,"from_id":4704,"to_id":4703,"type":"union"},{"id":3123,"from_id":4703,"to_id":4702,"type":"union"},{"id":3124,"from_id":4702,"to_id":4701,"type":"union"},{"id":3125,"from_id":4701,"to_id":4700,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3126,"from_id":4706,"to_id":4707,"type":"perform"},{"id":3127,"from_id":4708,"to_id":4709,"type":"perform"},{"id":3128,"from_id":4712,"to_id":4713,"type":"perform"},{"id":3129,"from_id":4713,"to_id":4711,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3130,"from_id":4710,"to_id":4714,"type":"perform"},{"id":3131,"from_id":4710,"to_id":4715,"type":"perform"},{"id":3132,"from_id":4715,"to_id":4714,"type":"non_coexistence"},{"id":3133,"from_id":4717,"to_id":4716,"type":"circumstantial_dependence"},{"id":3134,"from_id":4718,"to_id":4719,"type":"perform"},{"id":3135,"from_id":4720,"to_id":4721,"type":"perform"},{"id":3136,"from_id":4719,"to_id":4717,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3137,"from_id":4721,"to_id":4719,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3138,"from_id":4724,"to_id":4721,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3139,"from_id":4723,"to_id":4725,"type":"perform"},{"id":3140,"from_id":4725,"to_id":4726,"type":"perform"},{"id":3141,"from_id":4725,"to_id":4724,"type":"strict_dependence"},{"id":3142,"from_id":4727,"to_id":4728,"type":"perform"},{"id":3143,"from_id":4727,"to_id":4725,"type":"strict_dependence"}]}
