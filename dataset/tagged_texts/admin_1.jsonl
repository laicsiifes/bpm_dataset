Later, the process is closed.\n\nIf the customer is located, if necessary, their data is updated, and they are informed that all further notifications will be made by the provided email. \n\nThe complaint is registered, and the attendant tries to solve the problem. \n\nWhen the problem is solved, the customer is invited to evaluate the service, and the process is ended.\n\nWhen a problem is not solved by the attendant, a notification is sent to the QM, containing information about the problem. \n\nThe QM identifies the product or service and checks if there was any production anomaly on the date it was produced. \n\nWhen the Attendant cannot solve the problem, if the problem is related to a product, it is referred to the Product Analyst. \n\nIf the problem is related to a service, the attendant refers it to the Service Analyst.\n\nUpon receiving the problem referral, the Service Analyst performs the Problem Analysis process. \n\nAfter analyzing the problem, a diagnosis is generated, and a problem-solving procedure is also created. \n\nBoth are sent to the customer, and the process ends. \n\nWhen the process is referred to the Product Analyst, they check if the product is under warranty. \n\nAfter that, the analyst performs the problem analysis and sends an email to the customer with information on how to send the product to the company for repair and the cost of the repair. The process ends.","entities":[{"id":539,"label":"actor","start_offset":118,"end_offset":143},{"id":540,"label":"actor","start_offset":145,"end_offset":165},{"id":541,"label":"actor","start_offset":167,"end_offset":187},{"id":542,"label":"actor","start_offset":189,"end_offset":208},{"id":543,"label":"actor","start_offset":215,"end_offset":250},{"id":544,"label":"actor","start_offset":277,"end_offset":289},{"id":545,"label":"trigger","start_offset":289,"end_offset":318},{"id":546,"label":"condition","start_offset":377,"end_offset":432},{"id":547,"label":"actor","start_offset":434,"end_offset":447},{"id":548,"label":"activity","start_offset":448,"end_offset":481},{"id":549,"label":"actor","start_offset":520,"end_offset":532},{"id":550,"label":"activity","start_offset":533,"end_offset":591},{"id":551,"label":"condition","start_offset":595,"end_offset":646},{"id":552,"label":"actor","start_offset":680,"end_offset":692},{"id":553,"label":"activity","start_offset":702,"end_offset":715},{"id":554,"label":"condition","start_offset":716,"end_offset":738},{"id":555,"label":"actor","start_offset":740,"end_offset":741},{"id":556,"label":"condition","start_offset":741,"end_offset":774},{"id":557,"label":"catch","start_offset":776,"end_offset":797},{"id":558,"label":"activity","start_offset":802,"end_offset":882},{"id":559,"label":"condition","start_offset":885,"end_offset":916},{"id":560,"label":"trigger","start_offset":918,"end_offset":937},{"id":561,"label":"activity","start_offset":943,"end_offset":1003},{"id":562,"label":"actor","start_offset":1007,"end_offset":1019},{"id":563,"label":"activity","start_offset":1020,"end_offset":1031},{"id":564,"label":"actor","start_offset":1072,"end_offset":1076},{"id":565,"label":"activity","start_offset":1085,"end_offset":1103},{"id":566,"label":"actor","start_offset":1107,"end_offset":1114},{"id":567,"label":"catch","start_offset":1123,"end_offset":1144},{"id":568,"label":"condition","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1173},{"id":569,"label":"activity","start_offset":1189,"end_offset":1210},{"id":570,"label":"actor","start_offset":1216,"end_offset":1220},{"id":571,"label":"activity","start_offset":1225,"end_offset":1233},{"id":572,"label":"activity","start_offset":1303,"end_offset":1330},{"id":573,"label":"actor","start_offset":1336,"end_offset":1349},{"id":574,"label":"activity","start_offset":1350,"end_offset":1376},{"id":575,"label":"actor","start_offset":1408,"end_offset":1420},{"id":576,"label":"activity","start_offset":1432,"end_offset":1455},{"id":577,"label":"catch","start_offset":1461,"end_offset":1481},{"id":578,"label":"activity","start_offset":1531,"end_offset":1553},{"id":579,"label":"actor","start_offset":1557,"end_offset":1563},{"id":580,"label":"actor","start_offset":1609,"end_offset":1615},{"id":581,"label":"activity","start_offset":1616,"end_offset":1649},{"id":582,"label":"activity","start_offset":1654,"end_offset":1660},{"id":583,"label":"condition","start_offset":1661,"end_offset":1724},{"id":584,"label":"actor","start_offset":1733,"end_offset":1746},{"id":585,"label":"activity","start_offset":1754,"end_offset":1771},{"id":586,"label":"condition","start_offset":1772,"end_offset":1811},{"id":587,"label":"activity","start_offset":1813,"end_offset":1830},{"id":588,"label":"actor","start_offset":1831,"end_offset":1850},{"id":589,"label":"condition","start_offset":1854,"end_offset":1892},{"id":590,"label":"actor","start_offset":1894,"end_offset":1907},{"id":591,"label":"activity","start_offset":1908,"end_offset":1920},{"id":592,"label":"actor","start_offset":1921,"end_offset":1940},{"id":593,"label":"actor","start_offset":1980,"end_offset":1999},{"id":594,"label":"activity","start_offset":2000,"end_offset":2037},{"id":595,"label":"activity","start_offset":2070,"end_offset":2094},{"id":596,"label":"activity","start_offset":2100,"end_offset":2143},{"id":597,"label":"activity","start_offset":2156,"end_offset":2176},{"id":598,"label":"catch","start_offset":2182,"end_offset":2198},{"id":599,"label":"activity","start_offset":2206,"end_offset":2230},{"id":600,"label":"actor","start_offset":2234,"end_offset":2253},{"id":601,"label":"actor","start_offset":2255,"end_offset":2259},{"id":602,"label":"activity","start_offset":2260,"end_offset":2265},{"id":603,"label":"condition","start_offset":2266,"end_offset":2298},{"id":604,"label":"actor","start_offset":2314,"end_offset":2325},{"id":605,"label":"activity","start_offset":2326,"end_offset":2355},{"id":606,"label":"activity","start_offset":2360,"end_offset":2390},{"id":607,"label":"catch","start_offset":2489,"end_offset":2505}],"relations":[{"id":155,"from_id":547,"to_id":548,"type":"perform"},{"id":156,"from_id":549,"to_id":550,"type":"perform"},{"id":157,"from_id":552,"to_id":553,"type":"perform"},{"id":158,"from_id":544,"to_id":545,"type":"perform"},{"id":159,"from_id":566,"to_id":565,"type":"perform"},{"id":160,"from_id":573,"to_id":574,"type":"perform"},{"id":161,"from_id":575,"to_id":576,"type":"perform"},{"id":162,"from_id":580,"to
