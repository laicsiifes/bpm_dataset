The Training process at ACME aims to meet a demand for training on a specific professional topic within the Company. In ACME, the training process involves the HR Manager (HRM), Area Manager (AM), and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
The process begins with the Area Manager recognizing the need for specific training. They prepare a Training Dossier, which is a document containing the training details: Type of training, Employees to be trained, and Expected date. The Area Manager submits the dossier to the HR Manager. The HR Manager then plans the execution of the training, defining the budget, instructors, location, and schedules. They update the dossier with this information, send it to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for approval, and await the response. The CFO reviews the dossier and forwards the response to the HRM. If the training is "Approved" or "Definitively Disapproved", the HRM sends the response to the AM, along with the complete dossier, and the process ends. If the response is "Disapproved", then the HRM attempts to revise the budget proposal. If they succeed in modifying the budget, the HRM resubmits the proposal with the dossier to the Chief Financial Officer for re-evaluation.
