At the beginning of the enrollment period, each student must access the Academic System and subsequently choose the desired courses. Afterwards, the student waits until receiving the confirmation message for the accepted courses. The student evaluates the outcome. If the result is satisfactory, the process ends. Otherwise, the student can redo their selections. When the enrollment deadline expires, the process concludes with the student's last choice.
