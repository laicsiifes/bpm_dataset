The Order Information process aims to provide customers with information about the status and other details of their order. This process involves the following roles: Information Attendant (IA), Customer Relationship Manager (CRM), Transport Manager (TM), and Production Manager (PM).

The process starts with the Standard Activation Subprocess.  After locating the customer, the Order Number is requested. If the contact was made through a personalized email, this number is already identified by the system. After locating the order, if the inquiry is about a delivery delay, a Request for Reason Message (RRM) is sent to the Transport Manager. Upon receiving the RRM, the Transport Manager checks the issue with the order and sends a response back to the IA, informing the reason and the new delivery date. The IA then forwards the response to the customer, and the process concludes. If the inquiry is about changes to the order or cancellation, the IA records the query, sends a signal to the Products department informing of the customer's request, and the process ends.
