A pharmaceutical company has different business units within its manufacturing department, each producing a specific type of medicine. For example, there is a business unit looking after inhaled medications, and another one producing vaccines. The various business units make use of a direct procurement process for ordering chemicals, and of an indirect procurement process for ordering spare parts for their equipment.
