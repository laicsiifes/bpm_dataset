When a new call is received, a delivery driver must decide whether to accept it or not. To decide, they assess the GPS to determine if the traffic conditions will allow them to pick up the product in a timely manner. If the driver accepts the call and the company assigns it to them, they proceed to the pick-up location. Otherwise, the process ends. Upon picking up the order, they head to the delivery location. The driver also has a set time to make the delivery. If they are delayed by more than 10% of the estimated time, they lose an additional punctuality point. Upon delivering the product, the process concludes.
