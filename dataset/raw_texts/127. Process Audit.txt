Process Audit is a business process aimed at the quality of customer service. This process involves the roles Quality Manager (QM), Customer Relationship Manager (CRM), Production Manager (PM), Production Director (PD), and Market and Sales Director (MSD). 

Every month, an audit of the quality in the customer service processes is conducted. First, a statistical analysis is performed. If the data indicates a Critical Defect Index (CDI), a detailed report of the defects is produced and sent to the Production Manager. Upon receiving the report, the Production Manager must analyze all recorded occurrences, identify the causes of the occurrence. In case there is no identified cause, the PM must provide a justification for the occurrence. The PM forwards the report to the QM containing the actions to be taken to reduce the Defect Index. The PM analyzes the report from the PM. If the QM approves the report, the process is terminated. Otherwise, the report is sent back to the PM for reformulation. The process continues for a period of 15 days or until the report is approved. If 15 days pass and the report is not approved, the Production Director is notified of the report's rejection, and the process is terminated.

If the percentage of issues not resolved by the Attendant is less than 70%, the Customer Service Manager is invited to analyze the incident report and verify if the procedures adopted by the attendant were correct. After this analysis, the CRM must create a report identifying the causes and reasons for the unresolved issues. The approval of this report follows the same model as the report sent to the PM. If the report is not approved within 15 days, the Market and Sales Director (MSD) is notified. If none of these cases occur, a final report is generated, informing all actors involved, and the process is terminated.
