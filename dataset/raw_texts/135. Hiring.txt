Hiring is a Collaborative Process between a Candidate and ACME, formalizing the employment contract of the Candidate and commencing their professional activity within the company. In ACME, the hiring process involves the Candidate, Area Manager (AM), and HR Manager (HRM).

The process starts with the Manager receiving a notification of the recruitment process with the details of the Selected Candidate. Upon receiving the notification, the Area Manager confirms the hiring and informs the HR Manager of the start date for the new hire. This start date should not be less than 15 days away. Upon receiving the confirmation, the HR Manager requests the required documents from the candidate and waits for 5 days to receive these documents. If the candidate does not respond within 5 days, the Area Manager is notified, and the process is canceled. After receiving the documents, the HR Manager prepares the employment contract, requests the presence of the employee in the company to sign it, and waits for 5 days for the employee to come in and sign the contract. If the employee does not show up, the Area Manager is informed, and the process is terminated. After the contract is signed, the Candidate is informed of the start date and the location where they will work. The process ends.
