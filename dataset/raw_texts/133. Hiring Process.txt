The Hiring Process aims to fill a job position within ACME. In ACME, this process involves the following roles: Area Manager (AM), HR Manager (HRM).

The process starts with the Area Manager of a department requesting HR to hire an employee with a specific profile, providing the reason for the hiring. After the request for opening the position, the HR department analyzes and evaluates whether the recruitment process will be internal, in which case existing employees within the organization are identified. Employees who wish to change positions are assessed to see if they fit the desired profile. If no employee within the organization matches the vacancy, it is opened to external candidates.

In this case, HR creates the job description, selects the locations where the vacancy will be advertised (employment agency, social media, company's talent pool), and receives resumes from interested candidates. A screening process is then conducted to shortlist the professionals who best match the vacancy and company requirements. After the screening, the company contacts all pre-selected candidates and schedules job interviews. After scheduling the interviews, the recruiter conducts the personal interviews, confirming the information provided in the resumes. After the interviews are conducted, HR and the candidates evaluate which candidate best fits the company's needs. Once a candidate is selected, the hiring process concludes. If no candidate is selected, the HR Manager (HRM) informs the Area Manager (AM) that there were no selected candidates, and the process ends.
