A travel agency wishes to establish a reservation service for its clients. The service is triggered by a request received from the client and can return two different messages: an unavailability notification or a confirmation. Upon receiving the request, the business process of the service begins and then analyzes the request. If, for certain reasons, the request needs to be handled manually by an employee (for example, group trips), a subprocess for manual handling will be activated. Otherwise, the process enters a transactional subprocess, where a bus reservation and a hotel reservation occur in parallel. However, if either of these fails, the transaction is canceled and the subprocess ends with an error. After the cancellation, in the main process, a log message is recorded, and the unavailability message is sent to the client. If both reservations are successful, an attraction is booked by the Attraction subprocess, which interacts with an external service for attraction reservations. If the attraction reservation service does not respond in time, the attraction reservation subprocess is canceled (ends with an error), and a manual attraction reservation subprocess is executed. The manual attraction reservation always results in a successful reservation. After the reservation is successfully made, a confirmation message is sent to the client.
