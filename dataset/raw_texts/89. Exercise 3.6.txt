The process for assessing loan applications is executed by four roles within the loan provider: a financial officer takes care of checking the applicantâ€™s credit history; a property appraiser is responsible for appraising the property; an insurance sales representative sends the home insurance quote to the applicant if this is required. All other activities are performed by the loan officer who is the main point of contact with the applicant.
