A client wishes to establish an online meal service and requests the modeling of its fundamental processes, as described below:
The service should be available on the Internet and provide options to: (1) create or modify customer profiles, (2) select and remove items from a shopping cart, and (3) complete the purchase (checkout). Additionally, the definition of the (4) Delivery Process is requested.
Here is the description provided by the client:
The products are divided into two types: cold and hot. All cold products are simply taken from the warehouse, while hot products are prepared half an hour before the start of delivery. After the customer has chosen various cold and hot products, they can proceed to finalize the purchase. The checkout requires the selection of 1) a customer profile, 2) the delivery time, and 3) the credit card number, which is debited from the bank. If the customer does not have a profile, they are invited to create a new one. After the customer's profile is selected or created, the customer must confirm their information or may even update it. Once the checkout is completed, the order is saved, and the customer receives a confirmation email. The customer should be able to cancel orders at any time up to one hour before the delivery time. The meal service should frequently check open orders to prepare hot products in time for delivery. After all cold and hot items are collected or prepared, they are delivered to the customer. The day after the delivery, an email is sent to the customer requesting feedback on the quality of the service and the items.
