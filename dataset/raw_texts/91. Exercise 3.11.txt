When a new credit request is received, the risk is assessed. If the risk is above a threshold, an advanced risk assessment needs to be carried out, otherwise a simple risk assessment will suffice. Once the assessment has been completed, the customer is notified with the result of the assessment and meantime the disbursement is organized. For simplicity, assume that the result of an assessment is always positive.
