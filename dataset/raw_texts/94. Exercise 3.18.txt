In a court each morning the files that have yet to be processed are checked to make sure they are in order for the court hearing that day. If some files are missing a search is initiated, otherwise the files can be physically tracked to the intended location. Once all the files are ready, these are handed to the Associate; meantime the judgeâ€™s lawlist is distributed to the relevant people. Afterwards, the directions hearings are conducted.
