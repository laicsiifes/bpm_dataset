The Order Cancellation Process is a collaboration between the Customer and ACME with the aim of canceling a purchase order for a service or product. In ACME, the process involves the following roles: Sales Attendant (SA), Sales Manager (SM), and Inventory Manager (IM).

The process starts with the need to cancel an order placed by the Customer. The Customer retrieves the order details from their database, prepares a cancellation form, and sends it to ACME. Subsequently, the customer waits for the company's response, which can be either "Order Canceled" or "Request cannot be fulfilled," along with the reason. If the customer does not receive any response within 10 days, they resend the cancellation form and return to the sending task. If they receive the "Order Canceled" message, the Customer records the cancellation, and the process ends. If the "Request cannot be fulfilled" message is received, the customer evaluates the reason for non-cancellation. Depending on the evaluation, they either resubmit the cancellation request or simply end the process.

The Cancellation requests are received by ACME's Sales Attendant (SA). Upon receiving a cancellation request, the SA records it and forwards it to the Sales Manager (SM

). The SM reviews the cancellation request. If approved, they send the "Order Canceled" message to the Customer, and if it's an order for a product, they notify the Inventory Manager (IM) of the cancellation through a signaling event. If not approved, they generate a document stating the reason for non-cancellation and send it to the customer along with the "Request cannot be fulfilled" message. In both cases, the process ends.
