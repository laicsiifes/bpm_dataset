Contract Termination is a Collaborative Process between an Employee and ACME, formalizing the cancellation of the Employee's employment contract. In ACME, this process involves the Employee, Area Manager (AM), and HR Manager (HRM).

The termination process begins when an Employee or an Area Manager (AM) at ACME initiates a request for termination. If the employee initiates the request, they may or may not serve the notice period. If they do not serve the notice period, the request for termination should be included in their resignation letter, and the days worked will be deducted from the severance pay. If the resignation occurs before the end of the probationary period, the notice period is also waived. The HR Manager (HRM) calculates the severance pay. Subsequently, the severance payments are made, the employee is formally separated from the company, the Area Manager notifies the end of the employee's contract, and the process concludes.
