The Process Audit is a business process that aims to ensure the quality of customer service. This process involves the actors Quality Manager (QM), Customer Relationship Manager (CRM), Production Manager (PM), Production Director (PD), and Market and Sales Director (MSD). Monthly quality audits are conducted on customer service processes. First, a statistical analysis is performed. If the data indicates a Critical Defect Index (CDI), a detailed report of the defects is produced and forwarded to the Production Manager. Upon receiving the report, the Production Manager must analyze all registered occurrences, identify the causes of the occurrence. In case no cause is identified, the PM must justify the occurrence. The PM sends the report to the QM containing the actions to be taken to reduce the defect index. The QM analyzes the PM's report. If the QM approves the report, the process is terminated. Otherwise, the report is sent back to the PM for reformulation. The process continues in this way for a period of 15 days or until the report is approved. If the 15-day deadline expires, the Production Director is notified of the report's rejection, and the process ends. If the rate of unsolved problems by the Attendant is less than 70%, the Customer Service Manager is invited to analyze the occurrence report and verify if the procedures adopted by the attendant were correct. After this analysis, the CRM must create a report identifying the causes and reasons for the unresolved issues. The approval of this report follows the same model as the report forwarded to the PM. If the report is not approved within 15 days, the Market and Sales Director (MSD) is notified. If none of the cases occur, a final report is generated, informing all actors involved, and the process is terminated.
