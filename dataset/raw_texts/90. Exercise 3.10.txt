The process for handling downpayments starts when a request for payment has been approved. It involves entering the downpayment request into the system, the automatic subsequent payment, emission of the direct invoice and the clearance of the vendor line items. The clearing of the vendor line items can result in a debit or credit balance. In case of debit balance, the arrears are processed, otherwise the remaining balance is paid.
